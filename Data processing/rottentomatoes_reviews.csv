0,"There is something very 'Emperor's new clothes' about this film. It scored 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, -to put that in perspective, it scored higher than 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Citizen Kane'. So with my expectations high, I decided to watch it.

I totally get the profundity of its core message, I'm not an idiot, but the whole point of watching a film is to be entertained. The trouble is, like a lot of art there's far too much BS around the critiquing of it, to the point everyone nods in agreement at how amazing something is that plainly lacks a storyline or any sense of direction.

I wanted to like this film, I really did; but it was so unbearably dull. The characters barely say two words to each other throughout, and when they do speak it's done in a weird, grunty, jarring way in which people simply don't communicate.

I'll think twice before basing my evening's viewing on RT reviews because this is an awful film. I haven't missed the point, I just made the mistake of expecting to be entertained by a film.",Leave No Trace
2,"The movie was absurdly illogical with its ending. A father who will do anything for his daughter and demonstrates his unconditional love for her abandons her at the end for his selfish desire to return the woods where she had saved his life. That makes him a fraud. So he doesn't like life as a civilian and she had supported his life in the woods, nearly starving to death and experiencing frostbite. In return, he leaves the only person he loves to live the solitary life in the woods. This is a storyline flaw and what viewer would see this otherwise? To complete the logic of the plot and the consistency of his character, the final scene should have him return to the settler's camp and a week later and find her standing in happy tears. A good movie until an ending that is inconsistent with a father's supposed love for his daughter leaving her to think how much she had sacrificed her life for him only to discover he never really loved her as much as she had thought.",Leave No Trace
5,"I found this a very engaging film with Tom coming of age in her relationship with her father whose PTSD means he has to live in isolation. Beautiful scenery, no sex or violence and a film that appeals to all ages. Great acting by the two lead actors and a film that does leave a trace in those who watch it.",Leave No Trace
0,"One of the most BORING movies I've seen in over 65 years of watching movies from all over the world. I fell asleep 4 times while trying to slog through this snoozefest; and I was standing up! This director, Debra Granik, must be from the Droopy Dog school of fast-paced movie-making. I wouldn't touch anything else she makes with a ten foot alligator. A waste of both time and money.",Leave No Trace
5,"This is one of the finest movies I've seen in years. Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie are both outstanding in it.
Foster's Will character is a Gulf War veteran with PTSD. His wife has either died or left him, and he must raise his daughter (McKenzie). 
Will cannot cope with society due to his PTSD, and therefore lives in the forest raising his daughter Tom. 
The film follows their travels through the Pacific Northwest as Will hunts for isolation while Tom seeks human interaction. The end is touching. I don't cry when watching movies, but I did get some dust in my eyes about when the movie's climax hit.",Leave No Trace

2,"Why on earth did this aimlessly boring and depressing movie get 100% rotten tomato critic ratings? I thought there was going to be some positive change with both the father and daughter due to the misleading movie description.But it was interesting enough to watch the whole thing to see what would happen.The father continued to be a mentally ill father who was putting his daughter in danger and neglecting her needs and health.At least the daughter finally saw him for what he was in reality,once she got a taste of what life could be like.",Leave No Trace

4,"This movie is relevant in ways I did not expect. It dealt with PTSD with compassion and showed how it affects a person's loved ones. I was also impressed by how it dealt with making your own life choices. Although slower paced, Leave No Trace was a beautiful movie.",Leave No Trace
5,"I really had no idea about what this movie was before I watched it. I just saw the synopsis and thought, ""Hmmm... interesting."" and just went on with it. From start to finish until the credits were rolling, I was glued to the screen. This film was such an emotional rollercoaster ride for me.

It reminded me of the time my veteran grandfather was alive. He was like Will, very subtle and subdued, didn't want to feel ""stuck"" as the world continued to revolve around him. I personally witnessed how he dealt with his own thoughts and feelings most of the time. With the help of my grandma and I, he started to feel better until the passed away.

This film didn't need heavy action or drama scenes, just showing how people try to live and have normal lives was enough while dealing with themselves was already enough. The way the actors conveyed their emotions were compelling. The vibe of the film from beginning to end was so genuine, not forced nor lacking.

I truly want to find more movies like this as I've come to a stage of my life wherein I identify with Will most of the time; seeking a path to live my life, dealing with my personal demons, trying to make the most out of it. Hopefully more people open their minds and hearts to how this film is an eye opener to how our veterans are feeling everyday.",Leave No Trace

As she matures so do her needs and wants, and the realization that her father may be struggling in a way she never understood.

3,"Perfect example of why child services are necessary and vital for protecting children. 

The father was forcing her to live like a recluse, teaching her to hate the world because he couldn't deal with society anymore , he didn't want to work for a living and sacrifice to help his daughter be a regular kid with friends and school so he makes her fight for survival when a 13 yr old should be laughing with her friends and not having to worry about how to survive or where her next meal will be?  Just a selfish parent not putting their children first. 

Movie itself was an eye opener on what really happens outside of suburban communities, excellent performances by both actors and example of how blind loyalty is not always to the benefit of the person showing loyalty.",Leave No Trace
5,I thought it was so interesting and moving. Several themes through out. I kept thinking about it after watching it. I was so glued to and wondered how the story would end.

5,"This was an absolutely amazing heart felt movie, with deep insight. Foster didn't attempt to oversell the emotional distress of a combat veteran living with PTSD, by being an emotionally violent and unstable maniac that is portrayed in most post war movies. He simply wanted to be alone. A feeling many post war veterans share. There are two only two movie performances that illustrate the struggles of combat veterans. Those performances are by Bradley Cooper and Foster.",Leave No Trace

3,"Father and daughter are homeless and living in the woods. Through their close bond, they try by force from people outside their situation to become part of society again. Despite the lack of resources, Will is unable to connect with other communities and always wants to go back to where they were. While Tom, she is more and more open to explore what she could not in the past and to socialize with those who are part of where they are.",Leave No Trace
5,"When talking about movies in cases where less is more, ""Leave No Trace"" must be included in discussion. Director Debra Granik almost seamlessly films Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie in the wilds of Oregon. In almost every frame of the film, it feels as if these two people are real and we are spying on their private lives. In the scenes where dialogue is spare and Granik lets the camera roll on scenic wilderness, the audience feels thrilled more than it ever has been in a moment of silence in film.",Leave No Trace
3,"Thomasin Mackenzie and Ben Foster play daughter and father, Tom and Will They both live a sheltered existence away from modern society in the woods But something tips off the authorities giving their location; they are caught illegally setting up residence in a public park It's not illegal to be homeless but it's against the law to live on private property Tom is questioned by social services whether or not her father is suitable to take care of her keeping her away from an education in the real world They both against their better judgement adapt to our environment; working jobs, making money, eating home cooked meals to be independent Of course Will believes they're much better off where they were before Following the rules would separate them but Tom makes him acknowledge whatever's wrong with him means nothing is wrong with her The film works so much thanks to Mackenzie's stellar performance Foster gives one of the best moments in his career too There's also virtually no music giving it a reality-based feel, it's like you're actually with these people struggling to find a place to call their own far from the shackles of society It's above average maybe a tad overrated but not to be missed Director Deborah Granik almost follows the same spirit as 'Winter's Bone' but this follows two great performers Plot isn't the bigger concern nor melodrama but character is rich in this father-daughter story Even crowded environments feel like too much for most human beings so they need to find their own place",Leave No Trace

0,"This is the worse movie I've ever seen plot wise. In the beginning it gave me so much anxiety and I'm not sure why. I thought maybe the dad was abusive or maybe messed up in the head where he killed his wife or something, but no. He just doesn't wanna be with other people and abandons his daughter over it? So I guess he has ptsd talk about that a little more. I wanna know how different ptsd is for separate people.",Leave No Trace

0,"Wants to be emotionally deep or significant but it just comes off as boring and plodding, much like ""Into the Wild.""",Leave No Trace
4,"My initial reaction to the start of this film is that it very much reminded me of Captain Fantastic, which came out a few years ago. I find the plot interesting - the concept of people genuinely living out 'in the wild' so to speak. I thought it was quite an atmospheric watch and while the plot pace is quite slow and there's not a great amount of dialogue, I found it quite thought provoking, mainly in terms of it making me question how society rely on people living by their rules, or being judged harshly if not.

I could imagine what the father and daughter were thinking, at times in which their not speaking but clearly expressing themselves by way of body language. They are clearly very thoughtful people. I tried to imagine myself in their shoes, to think how I might regard modern society as someone previously living in the outskirts of it. Its a thinking persons film, I reckon. Not everyone will enjoy it, it might bore some, given there's no action scenes, no car chases etc. but as a character driven drama with some interesting themes (identity, privacy etc.), it was an intriguing and thoughtful watch. 

I also particularly liked the use of music in the background to add to the atmosphere in certain scenes - I imagine this would be worth seeing in a cinema if possible, for it does have a sort of mildly claustrophobic feel to it at times. Its one of those films which may well have you changing your mind about your opinions on the characters at different times in the plot but suffice to say things aren't entirely clear cut. There is also  certain poignancy present. In any case, I didn't find it a boring film - I found it somewhat moving, if anything.",Leave No Trace
2,"Another lost flixster rating.  This presented an interesting premise, but it didn't take a position on the issues.  Instead, it seemed to just ""observe"".  I liked the conflict between characters and the mental issues they faced.  However, it was tedious and I was frustrated with their motivations and ties.  Having lived in Portland, I appreciated their consideration of that culture.  I don't plan to see it again.  It was on Netflix.",Leave No Trace

5,"In a world of superhero movies, this film stands out and reminds you of what the art of filmmaking is all about.  No explosions, gunfights, or unnecessary sexual content, simply a group of phenomenal actors.  The story is both sad and uplifting and it says more about PTSD than any film I've seen in years.  The fact that this film was so underappreciated is an indictment of the viewing public.",Leave No Trace

4,Really loved this movie. Was very interesting the way the story came together and we get to understand the characters in the end.  Very heart warming and sad. It says a lot about how vulnerable we are and how we kind of don't really have much control over where our lives lead us as much as we think we do.,Leave No Trace

4,"It was a long time coming between feature films (Winter's Bone was released eight years earlier), but Debra Gronik's Leave No Trace was well worth the wait.  Dealing with her trademark themes of isolation, existential angst and assimilation, the film tells the story of Tom (Thomasin McKenzie), a teenage girl living with her father (Ben Foster), a military veteran suffering from what one assumes is PTSD, in the dense forests of Oregon, relying on nothing but their stealth and resourcefulness to survive.  While sparse in both dialogue and characters, the film is rich in depth when exploring the relationship between daughter and father as they slowly come to the realization that their respective roles as follower and teacher are coming to an end.  It is a deeply touching and heartfelt movie, thanks in large part to the phenomenal performance by the young Thomasin McKenzie.",Leave No Trace
4,"- Review in English -

Leave No Trace is a fairly mature film and without any objection, you manage to understand the problems these characters are going through. Thomasin McKenzie today has established herself as a great actress on the rise, but this 2018 film shows that her great work is reinforced from her first performances. The script and the direction demonstrate a great ability to show a point of view of these people with interests so intrinsic that they expand your way of seeing life.

- Rese√±a en Espa√±ol -

Sin Rastro es una pel√≠cula bastante madura y sin ninguna objeci√≥n, logras entender los problemas por los cuales atraviesan estos personajes. Thomasin McKenzie hoy en d√≠a se ha consolidado como una gran actriz en ascenso, pero esta pel√≠cula del 2018 demuestra que su gran trabajo se ve reforzado desde sus primeras interpretaciones. El guion y la direcci√≥n demuestran una gran habilidad para mostrar un punto de vista de estas personas con intereses tan intr√≠nsecos que expanden tu manera de ver la vida.",Leave No Trace

Dad is a war veteran who's chosen to raise his child in the woods, and he does an excellent job by all accounts. The daughter is healthy, happy and educated. It's only when the authorities find them and bring them into more normal society that trouble starts. The question becomes who will win. Will the father honor the daughter's need be part of a larger whole, or is his damage so deep that he has no choice but to live away from the world, with or without her? It's a heartbreaking (and true) story made all the more riveting by the two leads. In reading the reviews, I learned this same director made Winter's Bone, another story of an underage girl finding her way in the rural margins. I look forward to her next film.",Leave No Trace
4,"When you only have two main characters and a few supporting with very modest screen time, and the movie isn't tedious, then you know it's an above-average realization. So is the case with this drama: the credit belongs to director Debra Grenik, and actors Thomasin McKenzie and Ben Foster, who by some strange coincidence weren't nominated for an Oscar. The increasingly relevant topic of a life outside the system is beautifully presented through the relationship between the father suffering from PTSD and his teenage daughter, which is another advantage.",Leave No Trace

1,"The movie itself was realistically like 3 stars, not great not terrible, but It's getting a 1 because I got suckered in to watching this after seeing it got a 100% by critics, ridiculous.

There must be some horrible disconnect between critics and normal people because this was boring, drawn-out, and forgettable. PLEASE save a 100% rating for a movie that deserves it.

The movie itself: They walk in the woods, people try to help them and luckily nothing goes wrong, then they walk in the woods and finally they end up living in the woods with others who live in the woods. If you're waiting for something exciting to happen in the movie, you'll be waiting the rest of the movie. The first 20 minutes is how the rest of it goes.

5,"Not for the average vewier. It's a movie which requires thought. It's a movie which requires a certain experience with cinematography, it's not for everybody. If you are a shallow watcher, it's not for you. There's no unnecessary Holkywoodesque plot twists, no bombarding with action or pathetically sad scenes, no constant music attempting to override the overall mediocrity and emotional shallowness of obviously clich√© scenes. It's a wonderful story told in the most realistic and simplest yet complicated of ways where you must seek the information and the emotional enticing yourself. If you just like to watch a movie for what it is, it's gonna seem slow paced, when in reality what one might call slow pace, creates an over all tension which keeps you on the edge of the seat. It packs quite the emotional punch and it is insanely interesting if you actively try to make sense of it.

RATING: 4,9",Leave No Trace
4,"Perhaps taking some of its narrative cues from Manchester by the Sea (and incorporating past traumas that characters don't just ""get over""), Leave No Trace chronicles a network of conflicts: a veteran struggling between adressing his PTSD and caring for his daughter, a teenage girl balancing loyalty to her father and the fact that the rationale for their unusual lifestyle is nto shared between them, and the pair in contention with various aspects of the outside world that sees their existence as unnatural. There are no fists waved at the sky, no shouts into the void; pain is internalized but very much evident. The general narrative is perfect for modern drama - engaging and unusual but wholly believable, tackling larger issues that remain in social discussion but not explored in depth. Foster and McKenzie fully inhabit their roles, imparting a sense of authenticity and empathy that should rank among the best of 2018. (4.5/5)",Leave No Trace

4,"Gaining access to a new streaming service full of independent films, Kanopy, I was excited to see what they had to offer. So, being that Jojo Rabbit is my favorite movie of all time, and Thomasin Mckenzie (Elsa in Jojo Rabbit) starred in this, I figured that it would be fitting to start with Leave No Trace. In a lot of ways, I was reminded of Hunt for the Wilderpeople, except kind of the opposite. The arc of the characters goes on the same path as Hunt for the Wilderpeople, except backwards, which works. The story was emotional, and being that it deals with the affects of isolation quite a bit, I felt that it was very relevant to watch today. That being said, the movie has quite a few glaring issues. While the look of the film was clearly full of a strong motive and artistic passion, I just felt that overall, the way that the movie looked lacked differences between shots. Almost every shot was done in a very similar way, with a similar color pallet, which did sometimes make it difficult to make sense of some things. As mentioned, I was drawn into this movie because of Thomasin Mckenzie, from Jojo Rabbit, her performance of this definitely lives up to my expectations, she was definitely able to convey the appropriate emotions in an effective way. As for Ben Foster as the father, I enjoyed him at times, but truly, it seemed like he just really didn't do anything too great. In terms of the script, I thought it was fine for what it needed to be, which has kind of been my overall feeling with the movie. It's definitely an extremely fun movie, and it's one that's emotional in the right ways, however, it's nothing that's anything that great, it's slightly above average, which is still just fine. 8.3/10",Leave No Trace
2,"Another massively overrated film. The story is just a delusional dad with mental health issues dragging his daughter through the forest. They travel to a few different housing locations, they look depressed almost the entire time with the same facial expression throughout, and the dad doesn't even try to adapt. It's not emotional, it's just anger inducing at how stupid the parenting is. Some of what the girl does is also irritating because she's been indoctrinated. Things didn't feel realistic as everyone kept giving them free stuff - something that doesn't happen to most homeless people. To make matters worse, the ending was pathetic. The acting was acceptable but not great, the writing was dull and infuriating at times, the cinematography was fine, and the soundtrack was nothing special. I don't know who thinks uneventful films are enjoyable to watch because they're not. This film could have at least been somewhat emotional, but it wasn't.",Leave No Trace

My main complain is that characters are not fully developed, especially the father; though I appreciate when a director leaves many things to be discovered by the audience for themselves, in this case mystery is out of place, even to that extension that they don't even look as a father and a daughter and their homeless life is not believable.",Leave No Trace

5,"How nice to see an intelligent, quiet movie about real, decent people. ""Leave no Trace"" tells the story of a father (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter (Thomasin McKenzie) who have been living off the grid in an Oregon forest park, and getting by pretty well--foraging for mushrooms, cooking over a fire, drinking rain water, playing chess, sleeping in a tent. Occasionally, they hike to the nearest road and take a bus to nearby Portland for supplies, and so the father can get his anti-depressants and benzodiazepines at the VA clinic, which he doesn't take. He sells them to homeless vets living elsewhere in the park. 
Unfortunately, it's illegal to squat in a pubic park, and they get discovered. Well-meaning officials give them medical checkups and mental health tests and set them up with a place to live where the dad can work cutting down Christmas trees and the daughter can attend school. Oregon is well known for its ""socialistic"" programs to help the indigent, even though when the girl is asked by her counselor about being homeless, the girl doesn't know what the word means. As far as she's concerned, she had a home, and her dad took good care of her. 

The ensuing acts are about the girl adjusting to ""normal"" society, while her dad cannot. He's a Vietnam vet with PTSD, and for reasons unknown, he cannot tolerate any kind of communal existence where he has to interact with other people. 

The film does not preach. It also doesn't hurry. It runs at the pace of daily life. It's not a thriller, and it's not sensational, at least not in the Hollywood sense. But it is nevertheless brilliant. The performances by Foster and McKenzie are so good, we care about them in the first five minutes, and we follow them through their trials and tribulations with hope that all will turn out well. No spoilers, but let's just say the ending is bittersweet. 

The setting, the woods of the Pacific Northwest, is gloriously photographed. 

The metaphors are understated but meaningful: The bees, the spider webs, the animals, the lady who leave food for a homeless man. Pay attention and you'll get it  

Director Debra Granik's films are indies, with no huge studio backing, Her 2010 film ""Winter's Bone"" was nominated for an Academy Award.  ""Leave No Trace"" won several awards. It didn't get nominated for an Oscar, which it deserved, but Granik is not interested in playing Hollywood games.

Ignore all of the Hollywood big box office garbage and watch this one instead. You will be richly rewarded.",Leave No Trace

5,"Hot Take (maybe cold take): Toy Story 2 is the best Toy Story movie and a top 5 Pixar movie. This is the ""core"" of Toy Story. Buzz and Woody get along, Andy is still a kid and the gang is all together. 

Everything about this movie is brilliant. I feel like as the film was written a single line was written on the story board: ""What Happens to Toys when Kids Grow Up"". This fear is quickly instilled in the characters (particularly Woody), which ultimately pans out in Toy Story 3. 

There is an incredible depth brought not only to Woody, but Buzz and Jessie as well. The ""When She Loved Me"" scene is marvelous storytelling and rivals the opening of Up when it comes to heartbreak. Simply put, Toy Story 2 is perfection.

Best Character: Woody
Best Quote: ""I can't stop Andy from growing up, but I wouldn't miss it for the world!"" - Woody

5,All Time Classic. Everything is pretty much exactly on par with the first one. I love the new characters especially Jesse who has lots of depth. The story is more complex than the first and does what a sequel should across the board. Everyone gets added layers of depth. This moves just as fast if not faster than the first. The only issue really is this can get a bit jumpy in the middle with going between Buzz & The Gang in Big Al's and Woody with the Roundup Gang. The first one was a bit more tightly edited but this is still really well done and you get a more layered and complex story as a tradeoff which I'm really like. The animation is even better in this one with more complicated scenes and detail. Anyone who loved the first one will love this just as much if not more so.,Toy Story 2

Buzz flies through caverns, enters Zurg's stronghold, and gets defeated (gasp) by the evil Zurg! Is this the end of our hero?....Nah, it's just Rex playing the Buzz Lightyear video game and losing. It is Yard Sale Day and the toys are understandably tense. You see, Yard Sale Day means that the old toys go out to the sale. Woody has reason to be nervous, he's starting to show his age. He's got a ripped arm thanks to Andy's dog, whom we got introduced to at the end of the first Toy Story. Sure enough, one of the toy troop gets taken. Poor Weezie the Penguin was laid forgotten on Andy's bookcase and he promptly gets put in the sale box. It's up to Woody to save him, which he does. But he gets picked up by a greedy toy-collector named Al and taken to Al's Toy Barn. Seems Woody is pretty valuable and Al wants to sell him to a toy auction. Can Buzz and friends save him in time?

Ho-hum, sounds like a harmless little kid's movie, doesn't it? But remember Lassetter and the rules, or lack thereof? Well, things take quite a poignant turn.

In a magical sequence that's an homage to Howdy-Doody, Woody learns that he was part of an old 1950s children's puppet show along with some other toys from the show, the salty Prospector Pete (Kelsey Grammar), Jessie the Yodelling Cowgirl (played brilliantly by Joan Cusack), and Woody's faithful steed. As Pete tells Woody, toy collecting means immortality. Woody and his new friends will be preserved in cases for admiring eyes to faun over. Woody's days with Andy are numbered. This point is further emphasized by a heartbreaking song sung by Sarah Maclachlan that tells the story of how Jessie's owner abandoned her because, well, she grew up. Pete says, ""Do you really think Andy will take you to his high school graduation or to college?"" Talk about a bind. Does Woody go back to Andy and have fleeting fun or stay preserved in predictable permanence?

Meanwhile, Andy's gang have their own awakenings to paths not taken. Mr. Potato Head sees temptation incarnate in some friendly Barbies (""I'm a married spud! I'm a married spud!"") and Buzz comes face to face with a new Buzz Lightyear figure....who turns out to be as self-delusional as he was. You mean, they're all like this?! And the knockout punch: Buzz faces his mortal foe, Emperor Zurg and confronts a shattering secret. Hint: Think ""Star Wars.""

Pixar has come a long way since the first ""Toy Story."" The computer animation is absolutely amazing as the toys have much more dimension and realism in the details than the original. Once again everyone is terrific, especially Cusack who injects soul in the spunky and slighted Jessie. References abound, from ""2001"" to ""Star Wars."" Plus some inside jokes concerning Toy Story's lack of merchandise production also make their way. Even a sly suggestive joke or two slips in. Hint: Watch Buzz's wings at the end.

I cannot say enough about one sequence in particular with Buzz and the gang crossing the street. Lasseter directs this scene with great skill and comic placement. I was in tears at this point, and this was a ""kid's"" movie!

But, as with the first one, what really got me engaged was the story, as affecting a story as I have seen live or animated. If I can make an outlandish statement, Toy Story seems to be reaching for something akin to the ""Star Wars Trilogy"" or even the ""Godfather Trilogy."" Not so much for epicness, but for how the story gets deeper and richer as it goes along. ""Star Wars"" was an entertaining space opera, ""Empire Strikes Back"" was a mythic, dark, operatic chapter in a saga. ""Godfather"" was an exciting and classically-influenced masterwork, ""Godfather Part II"" was a quiet, dark, character study that reveals Michael's moral bankruptcy and the decline of the Corleone empire.

Lasseter's plan intrigues me. With ""Toy Story"", the plot revolved around a buddy picture that showed the bond between an old toy and new toy, and that being a toy is the best thing in the world. This bittersweet second chapter addresses what happens after the toys aren't needed anymore. What happens now? Where will I go? Will I be loved again? I wonder if with the third, if there is one, we'll see what makes a toy timeless. What separates a Woody or Buzz from Rex the Dinosaur or Slinky the Dog? And I wonder what the ultimate fate of our friends actually is. I'm hoping they get passed on to Andy's children and his grandchildren, throughout all the generations. I wouldn't worry about Buzz and Woody, though. They're already timeless.",Toy Story 2
4,es muy buena y algo malo que dicer nada todo es bueno,Toy Story 2
4,"Oh my goodness. This film is another Pixar masterpiece. All the characters are well written and funny (especially Zurg), and I did not expect that plot twist on my first viewing of the film. Good job, Pixar.",Toy Story 2
5,"Ah, yes, the olden years. What can possibly go wrong? Okay, so after I reviewed A Bug's Life, now I guess it's now the time for me to review a sequel which is my second favourite Pixar film, Toy Story 2. Why? Because right after the olden years, I have been a huge fan of the first Toy Story. Now with the sequel though, me and my friend Harry Kingston have been quoting all the lines in one day. Much like I reviewed The Jungle Book though, we've been quoting all the lines from these two Disney films non-stop. Oh, boy, I really do love animation! Right then, Buzz Lightyear again played by Tim Allen, is on his mission to find the Emperor Zurg right in the fortress. Whilst he find a battery, he found Zurg and defeats him but didn't and you can see that it's only a video game that Rex is playing. Woody, once again played by Tom Hanks, has got a ripped arm which is about a couple of minutes cause Andy has been playing with his toys, so he got shelved and started having a bad dream. As he wakes up, he found Wheezy the squeaky penguin and found a yard sale outside but was interrupted because Andy's mum coming to pick some old toys and took Wheezy with her, so now Woody had to get him back and was taken away by Al who works at Al's Toy Barn. As Woody is in the room where the unexpected toys are in here. One is Bullseye, second is Jesse played by Joan Cusack and third is Stinky Pete. As Woody don't know them but they do because they knew him from the TV show. So Buzz and the other toys, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Rex, and Slinky Dog, (which again portrayed by both actors) set off on the adventure to save Woody. Now as they're watching their TV show, Woody told them he has to get to home but Jesse got upset about it. As Al went to the room, he saw that Woody has lost his arm which is a funny scene. Now the funniest part though is that Woody tries to get his arm back but the TV is unexpectedly on. OK, there are some funny moments in this which I remember. Buzz and the gang found Al's Toy Barn and hide in the orange cones by walking the road and Buzz says ''Drop!'' and ''Go!'' everytime the car or truck gets by. The old man comes to fix Woody and his arm and like AL says ''It's just like new!'' As Buzz finding Woody, he saw a toyful of Buzz Lightyear's like himself and the other Buzz confronts him and drop him in the box and he gang comes across the Barbie store. As Woody know that Jesse is not happy after Woody is happy to get his arm back, Jesse remembers the flashback about that she was someone's favourite toy. As Woody go to leave, he decide to stay and Jesse is happy. So Buzz and the gang still looking for Woody, they heard Al coming, they went into Al's bag. Buzz had found the gang cause he saw Rex's tail and catches up with them but couldn't but did before Emperor Zurg is here. So as Al didn't take his bag, Buzz and the gang had to get out of the car and found an hole of the building and heard an earthquake which is an elevator and Buzz and the gang had to climb up to it. As they found Woody, they stop Jesse and the others and got Woody but was interrupted by the other Buzz Lightyear letting them reveal that he is the real Buzz Lightyear. Buzz told Woody to get back home but he didn't want to and decided to go with Jesse, Bullseye and Stinky Pete so they left. Woody watched the TV show and revealed that Andy is in it and changes his mind and decides to go with Buzz and the gang and told Jesse to go with them and Bullseye but Stinky Pete locks the thing and Woody found out that he is a baddie and got interrupted by Al who is late. So Buzz Lightyear and his gang were confronted by the Emperor Zurg and Buzz fights him and him and his gang go on the taxi where the alien from the first film is in and rides off. That's an awesome scene since I was a kid. As they're here they hide and go to the suitcase fortress to find Woody and Stinky Pete was defeated and now Woody, Buzz and Bullseye had to rescue Jesse. As Jesse is saved along with Woody, they go home and Andy is happy to be back home and find new toys. And now Woody and the gang are home and reunited to infinity and beyond Oh, and Wheezy has been fixed cause he got his squeaker back. Oh dear lord God. I have been watching loads of animation and this back in the older years and me and my old friends from old school had been non-stop quoting. That's what we all love to do. I have been watching Toy Story 2 on BBC 2 back at Grandad Bill's caravan after me and my parents been watching the first Toy Story back at Whitby. I think all the animated films are all on BBC 1 and 2 and I know all of the Disney classics and Pixar films by heart. Every scene, every quote and every song. There's also outtakes at the end of this film and they're are so funny I've been laughing at Stinky Pete farted in his box. This is an amazing movie. Really is just awesome all the way through. Much like Toy Story which is awesome, both films are really awesome and that is Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are all great films. Definitely good as each other. Yes, I know it's too much words and sentences to put out but that's just why I love watching animation and my friends quoting all the lines in every dialogue with me.",Toy Story 2

The movie expands on the beloved characters and world introduced in the first film, delivering a heartwarming story that is both entertaining and emotionally impactful. The animation is once again stunning, and the voice cast, including Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Joan Cusack, bring their A-game to the characters. The addition of new characters, including Jessie and Stinky Pete, adds to the richness of the film's world.

4,"I often struggle to put Pixar's mastery of the art of creating animated films during their golden age of the mid-90's through the mid-00's into words, but Toy Story 2 might be their absolute best. TS2 manages to stick the landing on almost everything it does, successfully running the emotional spectrum from humour to tragedy to action at a level that, even two decades later, most films fail to reach. It's almost unfair just how great Pixar used to be.",Toy Story 2

3,Amazing family movie for all ages!,Toy Story 2
4,"An even bigger scope thanks to the monumental first film's setup of it's lovable animated characters, makes the second film an even bigger hit than the original in my opinion. The story is a lot bigger and more is at stake then the first film but it still catches the heart and soul that is Toy Story. We still have all our favorite characters from the first film that fill the story with humor, which help balance the deeper aspects of the story and we are left with a balanced and enjoyable sequel. Highly Recommended!",Toy Story 2
5,"Amazing movie 
My second favourite",Toy Story 2
4,"Toy Story 2 does what any great sequel should do. The new character of Jessie is one of my favorite characters. Her backstory is heartbreaking, and in a way u can relate to her. The story and score is just as good as the first film, so definitely check this one out!",Toy Story 2

5,I Love the Toy Story,Toy Story 2
0,"Unrealistic, why wasn't this film using hyper-realistic computers to perfectly simulate the toys? Disgraced at Pixar for being so cheap. The only redeeming factor of this is the fact that it's only 95 minutes which is 5 minutes short of driving me into a sadistic mental state with the desire to kill everyone I see. They blatantly rip off the cartoon I made in school when I was 9, which I happened to *not* copyright, so Disney swooped down and stole my idea. They butchered the characters and the fact that they cut out the sex scene between Geri and Andy was such a poor decision. 0/10 Film.",Toy Story 2
3,Slightly better than the first but the same level. Just perfectly fine for kids.,Toy Story 2
5,A film that both improve and impress. Toy Story 2 shows a return of one of the best Disney films that honor the characters and they chemistry.,Toy Story 2

3,"great impementation of toy going to a toy store.
the supporting cast work great.
comedy is still funny",Toy Story 2
4,"A solid sequel that utilizes the same level of creativity as its predecessor while managing to never feel stale.

I totally dug the Woody origin story that was incorporated into this narrative but think the strongest scene, certainly on an emotional level, was Jessie flashing back on how she came to be in Al's possession.

I sure hope I never made any of my toys feel sad, lonely, or unloved growing up and, yes, Randy Newman is still killing it.",Toy Story 2
5,Another classic Toy Story movie that was just so ahead of its time and had such a great story.,Toy Story 2
5,Very rarely do you see a sequel that is just as perfect as predecessor. Pixar continues to deliver absolutely amazing movies.,Toy Story 2
3,"I can't understand how anyone can think that this is the best of the Pixar movies...or even the best of the Toy Story movies.  The whole ""Woody is an International Franchise"" positively wrecked it for me.  Why would they turn a simple beloved cowboy doll into a much-sought-after collection piece?  Also, Jessie's story would be a lot sadder and hit a lot harder without the blatant emotional manipulation of that insipid song behind it.  One was good.  Three was great.  Four was fun.  Two was...meh.",Toy Story 2
5,"All ages admitted!!!!!!!!! LOL, the funniest sequel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Toy Story 2
4,Eu gostaria de dizer que achei legal!,Toy Story 2
3,"Wow. This movie is so nostalgic for me. Probably watched it 2 dozen times in my childhood. So many memories. It's not as good as I remember, but my standards are definitely higher now than when I was like 8. Good plot, good choice of cast, arguably the best Toy Story movie, just pretty good. The CGI is a bit rough almost 25 years later, but it's still a good movie. Will probably be watching again, definitely not in the next year though. 68/100.

La aventura es genial, entretenida, perfecta para un ni√±o.",Toy Story 2
5,"Best animated Movie hands down. Its hilarious, full of charm, great refrances, complex, light hearted yet is so deep and realistic for a movie about toys. It deals with the concept of loss and abandonment, and what happens to you. Its also a metafor for death and what you shall choose in life. With an wholesome yet not naive ending. 10/10",Toy Story 2

5,"I love Toy Story, which I still think is the best Pixar animation to date, but Toy Story 2, not only surpasses its predecessor, ,it also manages to make rock-solid entertainment out of a simple story.

The animation is faultless. I could find nothing wrong with that. The script was just as irreverent and witty as the one in the first film, with jokes that adults will enjoy as well as kids. And the song When She Loved Me was beautiful and vital to the story.

The voice talents are also faultless. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are brilliant here as Woody and Buzz, but they were equally brilliant in the first too. Wayne Knight was also fine as Al, who kidnaps Woody to sell him to a museum. Joan Cusack was great as Jessie, though I do agree she has been better. Frasier's Kelsey Grammar is resoundingly entertaining as Stinky Pete(what a great name!). Solid support also from Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jodi Benson(Ariel from little Mermaid)and Annie Potts.

All in all, a fantastic film, that has enough visual jokes(like Wallace and Gromit) to satisfy adults and kids alike. Rock- solid entertainment that thoroughly deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox",Toy Story 2

4,"Toy Story 2 √© uma sequ√™ncia daquele primeiro que j√° avaliei por aqui, e ali√°s acho que at√© o 3 j√° fiz uma review tamb√©m, em uma necessidade de salvar um dos brinquedos de ir embora e ser vendidos a outros donos, chega um dilema, Woody come√ßa a pensar que por um incidente de rasgar o bra√ßo o seu dono Andy n√£o iria querer mais brincar com ele, e toda a figura do abandono come√ßa a aparecer, sendo que ao salvar o outro brinquedo acaba sendo roubado, e todos entram em desespero a tentar salvar agora o Woody.

O mais emocionante que √© um gatilho para muitos, depois de Woody entrar no local onde outros brinquedos tamb√©m est√£o prontos para serem expostos em um museu, o cowboy logo quer ir embora para voltar ao seu dono, mas Jessie compartilha uma hist√≥ria de quando era de outra dona, e no fundo tem aquela m√∫sica que come√ßa com 'Quando eu era amada...' n√£o h√° como n√£o arrancar uma l√°grima sequer, √© simplesmente comovente.

Uma reflex√£o que deixa √© que mesmo que o dono estivesse l√° brincando, se divertindo como uma crian√ßa deve ser no fim ele vai crescer e √≥bvio vai esquecer os brinquedos, que tanto amava, isso faz parte de um crescimento gradual do ser humano, e isso faz que ele amadure√ßa com o tempo, e isso mostrou perfeitamente no 3¬∞ filme.

Entre outras coisas esse filme traz novas aventuras como novos personagens, o Bala No Alvo, Jessie e Pete Fodido √© not√°vel que o abandono √© o foco desde o come√ßo do filme, e isso pode muito bem fazer em rela√ß√£o a crian√ßas que no orfanato podem n√£o ser adotadas, e essa rejei√ß√£o faz com que crescem nelas uma certa d√∫vida ao se relacionar com os outros, gerando bastante desconfian√ßa, sempre querendo ter certeza se a pessoa ficar√° ao seu lado, pois o lado de abandono √© presente mas isso j√° est√° virando uma sess√£o de terapia, devo parar por aqui, o filme √© emocionante al√©m de dar muitas li√ß√µes.",Toy Story 2

5,Classic animated movie. So many classic scenes!,Toy Story 2
5,Toy Story's first sequel doesn't disappoint at all. The addition of new cast members with old familiar faces makes the second outing of Toy Story thoroughly hilarious and enjoyable.,Toy Story 2
5,One of those incredibly rare instances where the sequel was just as good as the original. Love this movie!,Toy Story 2
5,My favourite Toy Story and Pixar film. You all know why it's so good,Toy Story 2
5,"The rarest of Pixar movies in which everything works. The new characters are visually entertaining and it's smart and witty writing make Toy Story 2 an absolute masterpiece  From it's storytelling, music, and animation this is  by far the Greatest Pixar film of all time.",Toy Story 2
5,My favorite scene was the burp,Toy Story 2
5,"With updated animation and a compelling story, Toy Stroy 2 is another fantastic feature from Pixar - and its as good as it's predecessor",Toy Story 2
3,"I liked it but it's not one I watch often at all, I would've rather seen Circle 7's toy story 3 be pixars toy story 2 instead of this one but it doesn't take away the charm of it",Toy Story 2
4,"Es una de las mejores secuelas de la animaci√≥n por que es divertida , tiene momentos pixar y no deja de lado a los personajes que ya conoc√≠amos en la primera , muy recomendable y es la mejor secuela del estudio pero lo √∫nico malo  es que el todas las secuelas de la trilogia  siempre solo tienen que escapar de las garras de un villano y regresar con Andy o Boonie",Toy Story 2
5,"That scene about Emily. Yes, the entire movie is great in every way but that scene is something else.",Toy Story 2
4,"Pixar's sequel to Toy Story has Woody being stolen by a toy collector and the rest of the gang must go on a quest to save him, but does he want to be saved? Once again Pixar ups the animation game, especially with the human characters. The new toy characters are welcome additions to the franchise, I am particularly fond of Jessie. Randy Newman returns as the music composer from the first movie and again really hits it on the nose. Jessie's origin scene is a wonderful blend of music and animation that gets an emotional response from me every time. Highly recommend this movie, go check it out!",Toy Story 2
5,IS A GOOOOOOOOOD MOVIE,Toy Story 2
4,An entertaining movie with emotional depth. The storytelling is commendable and the animation is gorgeous.,Toy Story 2
4,A worthy sequel to one of the most groundbreaking animated films of all time this movie is almost as good as the original and has an engaging plot when woody is kidnapped by a greedy toy collector its up to his friends to rescue him the prospector is an interesting character some of his dialogue foreshadows what happens in the next movie Jessie and bullseye are also welcome  additions to the cast,Toy Story 2
4,mi favorita de toy story,Toy Story 2

5,One of the best animated family movies ever.,Toy Story 2
5,"Even better than its predecessor, Toy Story 2 is a perfect sequel, by expanding the universe of the first film, continuing the story and the themes it introduced, and leaving an undeniable impact on the franchise, it truly is the ultimate sequel. Having some amazing comedy, arguably an even better score by returning soundtrack composer Randy Newman, wonderful new additions to the cast, a major improvement on animation, realistic and complex character arcs and a phenomenal climax. This movie is fantastic in every sense of the word. One of the best sequels and animated movies to have ever been made. It's bound to leave anyone who watches it speechless.",Toy Story 2
4,"the first one was definetly better, still fresh though.",Toy Story 2
5,"Ah, the perfect sequel I ever adored watching as a kid. Not only is Toy Story 2 my personal favorite of the series, but it is also my favorite of all Pixar! Woody has own character arc, as he should've had in the first movie, Buzz acts a true friend to save him, I liked both versions of ""You Got A Friend In Me"" Tom Hanks and Robert Goulet, and the Prospector twist caught me by surprise. I've always cherished this movie, and I'll keep doing so to the very end.",Toy Story 2
4,"Toy Story 2 was made because of the attention the first movie got. Toy Story 2 is just as good as the first, with more memorable characters introduced, and many famous scenes contain in this movie. Toy Story is the best franchise in Pixar.",Toy Story 2
5,"I now present to you the first truly great Pixar movie. From what I said in the first two reviews, the biggest problem I had with both Toy Story and A Bugs Life is that the stories are a little too simple and there are no real emotional moments. This movie is where those moments finally come into play. I am of course talking about Jessie's backstory, which made a majority of kids cry, including me when I was younger. Speaking of Jessie, the new characters that are introduced in this movie are great, the highlight being of course Jessie and Bullseye. If I truly had to nic pic one problem, it's that the Prospector (Stinky Pete) feels like a really lousy excuse for a twist villain. It just felt like the people at Pixar and Disney (I think they bought Pixar at this point but I could be wrong) said ""so there's a villain in this story right?"" Basically, it felt last second. However, this doesn't hurt the quality of the film at all. I remember Stinky Pete as not being too annoying, which I can't say for future villains by this company (cough, Incredibles 2, cough). Anyway, I love this movie, and chances are, you do too. Is this possibly the best animated sequel ever? Go to Disney+ and see for yourself!",Toy Story 2
4,"This movie is filled with Imagination, Feel-Good Vibes and Star Wars references ! Even the bloopers are great!",Toy Story 2
5,"Toy Story 2 was pretty awesome! This is actually the definition what a sequel should be. The animation is an improvement from the first movie and the story is actually better than the first film. I just find this one a tad bit more engaging. This time Woody is apparently a rare collectors item. He had a Tv Show called Woody's Round Up Rodeo. And was a really hot toy at the time. He finds this out after trying to save an old penguin toy named Wheezy from a garage sale. When he saves him though he gets taken by a guy name Al. When he finds out about his show, two new characters Jessie, and Bullseye tell their story of why Woody should stay with them. But of course he wants to get back home to Andy so there's tension between all of the characters. Toy Story 2 is to me the best out of the four. As much as I enjoy the first one I just thought that this one had more character growth and a whole lot of depth. I just had a lot of fun with this movie and I honestly think that this is my favorite sequel out of the Toy Story franchise. 10/10",Toy Story 2
4,"A very good movie from back when I was a kid...Good animation and a great, compelling story, it too is another good movie from Pixar",Toy Story 2
5,the best toy story movie,Toy Story 2

5,Toy story 2 Is one of the best Movies and one of the best Pixar movies too It ages really good when to me toy story 1995 doesn't age all too well I like the whole story too with some of the past stuff woody which was actually interesting and than we have Jesse which I didn't like at first toy story 3 makes her character really good too i like the buzz lightyear past stuff very cool looking villian I grew up with this movie this one always my least fav from the toy story franchise i think this could be my fav or second fav now when watching it on this rewatch I think every character is perfect to in this movie like the first one the villian was a kid and i didn't like it like the toys were cool in the first for the villian side but the villain itself i didn't like but this one I always loved him like not really a villain a guy who works at a barn what sells toys and wants to get a lot a money if he gets woody he gets to go to Japan is why he stole him in the very beginning of the film I did like the whole comedy route too with when everyone is going to the barn where they think woody is at and slinky half body needs to catch up was so funny i liked that but all round an movie I wanted to watch to see how it lives up to the original and for me is wayyy better than the original by villain a villian and characters too so I give Toy story 2 an A+ And 98%,Toy Story 2

It showcases how childhood is a very important part of every person's life.",Toy Story 2
4,This was actually a great sequel and had another great story,Toy Story 2
4,Even better than 1 if that's possible.,Toy Story 2
5,"Pixar is improving: near perfect...
I just saw Toy Story 2 an hour ago and I must say that, despite all the great reviews, I was still surprised about the quality....It started absolutely marvellous; one of the greatest and humorous opening sequences ever. The plot is really smart, the animation is brilliant and the humor...Oh man! The last 50 minutes must be the most fun 50 minutes I had in years and believe me, I'm NOT exaggerating. It seems impossible to imagine the fun the writers must have had, because this is a true film-fest whether you do like Disney-esque films or don't.

Having this fast-paced storyline, John Lasseter & Co. exploited it to a maximum. Cameo's from Pixar-characters (Geri's the coolest), unexpected and obliged references to other big films (really love the Jurrasic Park one), great new characters (Wheezy!!), and more jokes and gags rammed in an animated feature than you'll ever see and of course the out takes.

The action-department is also greatly represented in some astonishing sequences with great, original shots and angles. The music is moody and Randy Newman is at his best with the really non-disturbing, appropriate song about Jessie, which is definitely the message of this film.

O.K., I know I'm raving, but I really meant it when I chose the ten and clicked the ""Vote"" button. This film is great and I recommend it to every film-lover.

A few downsides (this hardly affects the overall film) are I think, first of all the lack of originality, which is excusable and acceptable for a sequel. Second, the still somewhat jerky animation of the humans (I know they said it was supposed to be, but I disagree that). And third: the ratio, 1:1,85 (I thought it was the theater, but Pixar is forgiven, seen the quality of the film.) These are minors things and my decision is final, Toy Story 2 is certainly included in my top 20.

O.K., now you may stand up and ring a friend to go and see it, come on!!",Toy Story 2
5,Good not as good as the First one,Toy Story 2
5,"This is a movie that I'd argue expands and improves on nearly every aspect of the original, which is probably the hardest yet most important aspect of making a sequel.  Some of the scenes are unnecessary and not very fun to watch, but it added a lot of emotion in a way that would become a staple of the franchise, and the characters and relationships are just as good and even more fleshed out than the original.  This is, in my opinion, one of the best sequels ever made, and one that easily surpasses the quality of the original.",Toy Story 2
5,Toy Story 2 is a masterpiece of a sequel coming off of the coattails of one of the most revolutionary animated films ever. Its vibrant colors and improved story make for a fun movie-going experience that progresses the mythology of its predecessor rather than just do the same thing.,Toy Story 2
5,"With Toy Story 2, Pixar and Disney not only managed to equal its predecessor, but actually surpass it. While elevating the stakes and expanding the cast, this film manages to balance humour and heart and a mature story to produce an experience for the whole family. Seriously, how do you make one of the best animated movies of all time better? I'd also like to take a moment to appreciate the studio for going to the effort of animating bloopers during the credits scene. Now that takes dedication.",Toy Story 2
5,"Out of all the Toy Story movies, this has always been my favorite one. With characters like Jessie and Bullseye joining the toys and even a villain like Stinky Pete, I feel like this movie is just leaps and bounds better than the first movie and the other sequels. Even though the first movie was fresh and original, there was still an air of depression that followed me around after I was done watching it because of the condition and treatment of the toys by some humans as well as other toys. I did not get that vibe from this movie in the slightest and I highly recommend it for people of all ages.",Toy Story 2

(B+)",Man on Wire
3,"In August 1974, Frenchman Phillipe Petit and a handful of accomplices secured a tightrope between the towers of the World Trade Center and, for forty-five minutes, entertained on-lookers and taunted the police.  Man on Wire, a documentary chronicling the event, is a taut and thrilling account of the event, using still shots, present day interviews with those involved, archival footage, and newly shot recreations of events.  While the stills, interviews and archival material are all endlessly fascinating, many of the recreations feel unnecessary and serve more as padding than anything else, hurting the overall impact of the movie.  Despite this, regardless of how you judge the actions of Petit (a self-absorbed narcissist or a free-spirited rebel or something in between), Man on Wire never fails to entertain.",Man on Wire

3,"Philippe Petit, a self-taught French highwire artist, falls in love with the unfinished World Trade Center towers and daydreams of walking the cloud-level span between them. Together with an international band of comrades, girlfriends and stoners, he perfects his craft, tests his will on lesser structures, invents a disguise to access the buildings and touches heaven during an unauthorized fifty-minute balancing act, far above the bustling morning sidewalk commute.

There's a sense of faded liberty and wild west potential to this caper, the kind of thing that couldn't possibly happen in today's world of digital surveillance and trigger-happy security. Here's a man from the other end of the world, inspired by a puff piece in the paper, who managed to accomplish a lunatic notion by employing persistence, elbow grease and a few flimsy counterfeit work orders. His is a tale of DIY wonder, if a little inflated and aggrandized by the telling. In the absence of archival footage (a few stunning photographs provide the only record of his feat), we're left to gape over TV grade re-enactments and breathless recollections from a number of winking, grinning sources. It's a fantastical story, but the lack of footage is disappointing, and Petit's voiceover sometimes feels a little on the unreliable side. He is, after all, a born showman.",Man on Wire

He's amazing and great at it but is pretty cocky and ends up ditching his friends, cheating on woman who's supported him the whole time, and ultimately makes a documentary about the whole thing and its 10 minute of fame.

I was disappointed because the act itself was memorable and definitely amazing, especially since Director, Marsh aimed to tell a story that would bring an illuminating light on the Twin Towers. But, unfortunately, I have seen more captivating docs and I believe this one failed. I don't think it should have taken home an Oscar. I vote for Trouble the Water.",Man on Wire

The documentary tells the story like a heist film, which makes sense since the folks involved had to figure out how to sneak into the not-quite-completed World Trade Center and string a wire between the buildings without anybody noticing.  There are some problems with how the story is structured ... there are repeated assertions that one fellow was not trusted by any of the others, but this never actually amounts to anything ... but when you finally see Philippe Petit walking on a tightrope, it kind of washes away any small problems with the film.",Man on Wire

4,Why? Because its there!,Man on Wire
4,"A quirky, fun, and thrilling telling of a, well... a quirky, fun, and thrilling stunt. 'man on Wire' is just as cool as it looks. 

Petit is a funny and charismatic man, which is especially important given how dependent this film is on him telling his own story. The format is simple- take those involved and interview them about the events, all the while showing re-enactments of the stories and actual video footage when relevant. This is playing it safe but only, and ONLY, if the story has enough going for it. That's the difference between a decent film and a great one when you follow a structure like that. 

Unsurprisingly, sneaking into the twin towers and walking across them on a tightrope- that's, um, a pretty brilliant story. All of Petit's passion and drive comes through and fits so perfectly with his stunt that the film just has a wholeness to it- it informs and inspires. It makes you think but it doesn't leave you questioning. You just get it- you feel what Petit is experiencing, even if you haven't experienced it yourself. Sure, watching this isn't actually going to feel like you're only one step away from guaranteed death (thankfully!?) but it's still good, okay!?

Everything this film represents is a perfect tribute to the towers that once stood. That's not what this one is about though- it's about re-living a moment with those who were there and, boy, what a moment it was.",Man on Wire
5,"Man on Wire: the film's title tells us everything and nothing. Yes, this is a documentary about a man who illegally tightrope walks across a wire. But to reduce such artistry, such magnificent talent and effort to simply ""Man on Wire""? That is the real crime here. Granted, the title bears historical accuracy; we see Phillipe Petit's police report toward the end of the film with the words ""man on wire"" scrawled in the description. 

Suspenseful, energetic, dramatic: all words to describe not only this film, but the main man himself. Petit is a true character-he keeps us engaged with his mysterious yet magnificent obsession with being hundreds of feet in the air, dancing across a single wire suspended between the notorious Twin Towers. It also doesn't hurt that he's so bubbly and spirited, keeping the film quick-paced for the most part. And who better to direct such a film than James Marsh? Though Marsh's actual voice is never heard throughout Man on Wire, this does not stop him from getting it across. He places an immense focus on celebrating Petit's walk across the Twin Towers, in the most light-hearted and whimsical way possible (both of these attending to his voice, I might add). Marsh tells Petit's story beautifully, utilizing a combination of talking-head interviews, archived footage/photographs, and reenactments to take us (the viewers) through this exhilarating journey. We really get a sense of the type of filmmaker that Marsh is through Man on Wire. The way he takes extra steps just to make the film more ""artsy"" for viewers who may or may not pick up on such minute details, magnificent! In the very beginning moments of the film, we see archived photos of Petit as a child juxtaposed with archived film of the Towers being built. Marsh sequences the photos in such a way to draw parallels between them and what's going on in the film. Killer scene!-absolutely stunning. 

Yes, admittedly there is a lack of moving archived material in the film, but who is to blame for this? Certainly not Marsh, and probably not Petit or his crew either. It seems that Petit's intention was not to record the moment, but to rather live it. Though his crossing did make a beautiful performance (which we see through the stunning archived photos of his seemingly ant-sized body suspended on a wire), his decision to do the walk in the first place can be attributed to his sheer obsession with the project and Towers, not any desire to ""put on a show.""

What's interesting to me is evidence of the binary we see toward the end of the film. We know that, through his careful composition of materials, Marsh intended for his film to be cheerful, airy, and humorous (among other things of the like). This calls into question the last few minutes of the film, which bring a more elegiac feel, an ambiance that catches us a little off guard considering the otherwise up-beat moments throughout. It's worth noting that Marsh never explicitly mentions the horrific events that took place on September 11th, 2001 (interesting, especially since Man on Wire was released 7 years later). This was no accident, of course. Marsh definitely did not intend to put a damper on the occasion. His main focus was celebrating the walk, but he does create a sort of elegy for the towers with his exquisite layering and sequencing of archived film, interviews, photos, and music (during the film's final moments, in particular). As Annie (Petit's ex-lover) speaks of the ending of her romantic relationship with Petit, she says ""our relationship was meant to end here, and it was beautiful that way."" Instead of the camera remaining fixed on Annie's face, it pans around the Towers while a soft, touching lullaby twinkles in the background. Marsh is trying to point out that like their relationship, the Towers have also ended. The soft music brings a touching (almost mourning) feel to the moment, which further implements the minimal elegiac aspects of the film. Another killer scene! If we're giving credit where it's due, all praise goes to James Marsh. He took this amazingly creative event and strung it together in a way that made it all the more exciting. Hats off, Marsh!",Man on Wire
2,I was dissapointed. The documentary touches on really interesting things but then just abandons them. I was just a bit under whelmed with the story to be honest. And that makes me sound like a dick head because this guy walked between the twin towers with a fucking rope but the documentary just wasn't executed very well.,Man on Wire
5,"I was actually interested and looking forward to see Man On Wire, but I felt like it might be boring. When I come across the trailers for Robert Zemeckis's The Walk, it got me curious enough to watch this documentary, even though I watched The Walk, and it was more interesting then I thought of the documentary. Philippe Petit is really interesting to you can tell that it's his dream to walk across the Twin Towers on a wire. The other interviewers were interesting also, and it does get a bit suspenseful when they were hiding from a police officer. When Philippe does wirewalk, it gets intense that you're just hoping that he doesn't fall. It does get you to know a lot about Philippe Petit, and he kind of talks fast and reenact the past situation that he was in which is interesting. The documentary does lead itself to a surprising end which is unexpected for this genre, and I'm glad it ended that way and watched an amazing documentary movie out of it.",Man on Wire

4,"Well, I get it now. After finally getting around to watching this, I totally understand why people love it so much. It feels more like a caper movie than a documentary. It's exciting, beautiful and poignant. While it's hard not to be a bit sad at parts now that the twin towers are gone, the movie is in many ways a lovely tribute to their creation and the awe they inspired in so many people, including one totally crazy and amazing Frenchman.",Man on Wire
3,"An amazing story I still can't really believe didn't end with a disastrous death. Petit is an almost ghost-like magician to have pulled off this feat. This documentary is a bit more emotionally compelling then the dramatic film ""The Walk"", which in part is because Petit is a nearly impossible character to truly understand. So the only person who can play him is himself.",Man on Wire
3,"Based on the memoir of Philippe Petit, Man on Wire tells the extraordinary story of one of the most daring artistic coups of the 20th century.  In this documentary Petit and his team recount their 1974 exploit of rigging a high-wire between the World Trade Center towers (still under construction at the time) in order for Petit to give a wire walking performance.  In addition to the interviews, original footage and re-enactments are used to help complete the story; showing how the team planned and trained for the event (infiltrating construction crews, building scale models, etc.).  However, the filmmakers don't explore the larger context; the impact that the event had.  Still, Man on Wire is a remarkably compelling look at a feat of incredible ingenuity and audacity.",Man on Wire

3,"I was a little irritated after having seen this movie. I should have seen it earlier. First I read the book ""To Reach the Clouds"" which is basicaly like Man On Wire but in book-form. Then I saw the movie The Walk. When I saw the movie there were things that I couldn't really remember reading in the book so I kept wondering if it actually happened or if it was made up especially for the movie. Then I saw the documentary and I realised that all of the things from The Walk that I thought was fiction, actually happened in real life. So I wish that I'd read the book first, then seen the documentary and last but not least seen The Walk. Then I probably would have enjoyed The Walk even more than I already did.

All you have to do to make the documentary interesting is point a camera at him!  I thought that the flashbacks were a little strange at times, but even so they got the point across and conveyed what happened in real life.  The structure of time in the documentary was enjoyable though, especially with the first few minutes leaving the viewer in suspense about what was happening.

5,The  cult of Philippe,Man on Wire
5,"Philippe Petit: It's impossible, that's sure. So let's start working.

Never, in the history of the cinema, in the history of everything I've experienced, have I seen someone so passionate as Philippe. He's one of the most wonderful and energetic human beings to see in a movie, and it's all the more amazing to know these events are true. ""Man on Wire"" is a masterpiece. It's a documentary of wonder, joy, passion, beauty, and one of the few that speaks of experiences of The World Trade Center, without even once mentioning terrorists on the fateful day.

There comes a point in ""Man on Wire"" where Philippe and one of his friends (he had a group helping him sneak in, which the documentary will cover in detail) have to hide under a tarp to escape one of the guards. It's a heart pounding moment, but for whatever reason, perhaps the way Philippe explains the events, we feel overjoyed and almost excited for him. It's a feeling of innocence, even though they had been breaking in. It's child-like, and that's a perfect way to describe Philippe. He's child-like not in an ignorant sense, but more of joy. This movie is very joyous. 

Documentaries are made on topics that the makers are interested in. You'll see, that when watching ""Man on Wire"", everyone speaking about the events are very passionate about it. It's a powerful emotion, truly. Philippe describes everything in almost Shakespearean caliber. It's absolutely beautiful, and one of the most interesting stories I've ever heard, true or fiction. It's wonderful, superb, I can just keep listing positive adjectives, and I'm sure you could too, and I'd agree with it.

""Man on Wire"" is the finest documentary film ever made. ""Hoop Dreams"" has often been called the best, which I would definitely say is excellent, but there's something about ""Man on Wire"". The music, the feeling, it's a haunting movie, but it's a movie whose subject breaks the law; it's not violent, it's not cruel, it's for a wonderful reason. Philippe, at the end, is wirewalking, even at his age. A lifetime has been captured in this film. From his younger days, to the event we just love to hear about, it's all about love for what he does. ""If I die, what a beautiful death!"" 

That's how every man ought to go: happy. Philippe survived, gleefully. He toyed with the officers waiting for him, and he balanced on of their hats on his nose. He never showed fear. While he was brave, the reason he didn't show fear was not bravery; it was his love for what he did. This is why he was put on Earth.",Man on Wire

Excelente selecci√≥n de m√∫sica de Michael Nyman, quien entrega varias piezas de sus otros trabajos.",Man on Wire
5,"""Life should be lived on the edge of life.

4,A lot of its greatness comes from Petit's Shakespeare-like way of describing his experience. Absolutely wonderful.,Man on Wire
4,"Never abandon your dreams, no matter how outlandish they are.  This is about a tightrope walker, Philippe Petit, and all of the events leading up to him walking on a wire between the roofs of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers.  Now this was something that I knew very little about; this all took place 12 years before I was born, so this story had already come and gone before being unearthed again for this 2008 documentary.  This jumps right into it, and it isn't long before you are getting dizzying shots of this man defying death, with the only thing between him and a fatal fall is a wire that is less than the width of his shoe.  At a distance, it looks like he is walking on air, and it is a stunning and jaw-dropping sight to behold.  It is really fascinating, and one thing I really wasn't expecting was how much this ends up playing out like a heist film; this is a highly illegal act that this crew is helping this man perform, and while it's only Philippe that is putting himself at huge personal risk, they have to evade a number of security guards, as this is an offense that can result in incarceration.  Man on Wire keeps the tension high, with well shot cinematography and smart editing.  It keeps you in the engaged by taking a look at this man's past and present, and it all builds to this insane stunt for the ages.  It's a fascinating character study, and I can really respect this kind of drive in a man, and even more so when the guy actually follows through with it.",Man on Wire
4,"Great documentary with a delicious directness

A great documentary that left me thinking about my own life and dreams. Not only the content and larger-than-life feat performed in the movie are its strong points, but also the directness and authenticity of the interviews with the people involved in the stunt. The strength in this is that it doesn't make the documentary something far-off, distant and unrealistic idealistic, but rather something very close.

In my opinion, the scenes should have been rearranged. It would have been better to work chronologically toward one climax instead of flashing back and forward in time. This killed the tension. The whole should more closely reflect the natural accumulation of tension Philippe and his companions experienced when coming closer to their performance, not only making it a climax for Philippe, but for the viewer too.",Man on Wire

Grade: A",Man on Wire
4,"Around 3 years ago, I had heard so much praise for this movie called Man on Wire. I didn't know what it was about other than it was a documentary about a man who tight-roped across the Twin Towers. It won Best Documentary at the Oscars that year and it still to this day maintains a 100% rating on the Tomatometer. I had to see how great this movie was for myself. I sat down to watch it and I fell asleep within the first half hour. Needless to say, I was not impressed, I was perplexed at how it had a 100%. After years of being told to give it another chance I finally decided to sit down and watch it again. I do not regret that decision.

Philippe Petit is a fascinating person. A man who is willing to put his life on the line (no pun intended) for his passion is powerfully inspirational. Even though you know that he won't die, it's still horrifying to watch. Chills ran down my spine every time it showed the man in action.

Man on Wire is among one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It has some dry portions where nothing happens, but that doesn't take away from the overall quality of the film. It's a beautifully shot and expertly told tale that will leave you breathless.",Man on Wire
4,"Another solid documentary, this film looks at one specific event - the high-wire acrobatics of Philippe Petit on the World Trade Centre.

It gives quite a detailed look at Petit and his accomplises set up the remarkable event (with some details that, I suspect, would not have been revealed on film had the towers still been standing) and gave an insight into the sort of madness one needs to possess to attempt such a feat.

A great and informative, and suspenseful, documentry.",Man on Wire
4,"The images of Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in New York evokes an indescribable majesty. There's something so exhilarating and whimsical about seeing a man laying in the air, 110 stories above ground. 

Adding to the excitement is the manner in which Petit and crew pulled off this illegal, audacious activity; a fine example of how fact is often stranger than fiction. Michael Nyman's score contributes to the vertigo-inducing action and Petit's infectious enthusiasm for his achievement (and life in general) makes 'Man on Wire' a fascinating, must-see tale.",Man on Wire
3,"Very interesting documentary, on a very interesting man, and his dream to walk between the twin towers. I only wish we could see a section on how he felt when the towers were destroyed. I am sure his heart must have broke when he saw that vision.

3,"An unnecessarily prolonged documentary, forcefully expanded twice its required length in order to tell a story much more interesting than its cinematic execution. The emotional fillers do not add anything to the story. I appreciate the balance maintained between seriousness and the comedic moments: anecdotes are anecdotes. The commentary regarding how an intrepid pursuit of a life dream that does not fit into the liberalism structure of our economy and the conservative laws around the world is cataloged as ""guilty"" under the charges of ""trespassing"" and ""disorder behavior"" is amusing. We saw the inspirational message of never giving up, of not allowing ourselves to live restricted to rules, etc., coming from miles away. But how can I buy it? A fearless man is recommending me to evolve an intrepid mentality and break borders. He should have also made people remember that such process should not necessarily lead to illegal actions, life-risking activities or simply achievements that surpass average standards, because no profession or ocupation is better than the other, or more admirable.

Wrongfully, the entire story is called at the very end a ""love story"", because thanks to that typical fanatism that people have for worshipping deeds like that of Philippe, he scored and got a girl, resulting also in sequences of unnecessary graphic sexuality, maybe to remind us of the naughty French spirit? It is indeed a love story, but to a dream come true. The Academy choosing this average documentary over Herzog's work is actually more fearless than Philippe's deed! I rest my case with that statement.

With its mixture of found footage, stills, recreated scenarios, and interviews it just meshes so well, and thats just the technical side of it. The narrative has a known ending, but it still is thrilling and ultimately spellbinding.

3,"Dokumentarfilme sind immer so eine Sache. Viel mehr als Spielfilme sind sie oft von Tagesaktualit√§t betroffen und selbst einige gro√üartige Werke haben mittlerweile ihren Biss verloren. Die meisten geraten bereits nach wenigen Jahren in Vergessenheit und verlieren an Relevanz.

Bei James Marshs Man on Wire"" hatte ich andere Erwartungen. Immerhin erz√§hlt der Film die Geschichte von Philippe Petits Gang √ºber ein Drahtseil, gespannt zwischen den Twin Towers. Ein Dokumentarfilm √ºber ein historisches Ereignis (es fand 1974 statt), sollte demnach √ºber den Zahn der Zeit erhaben sein und nach f√ºnf Jahren noch den gleichen Effekt erzielen wie in seinem Erscheinungsjahr.

Nun ja, wahrscheinlich war der Film bereits 2008 etwas... langatmig. Hochgepriesene Dokumentarfilme sind meist nicht blo√ü (oder in den seltensten F√§llen eigentlich, wie in den Dokus von Michael Moore) wegen ihres Inhalts interessant, sondern wegen ihrer technischen Brillanz oder k√ºnstlerischen Innovation.

Eine Mischung aus Interviews, nachgespielten Schwarzwei√üszenen, noch mehr Interviews und sp√§rlicher historischer Aufnahmen k√∂nnen kaum zu diesen Punkten gez√§hlt werden. 
Man on Wire"" war demnach f√ºr mich auf dieser Ebene eine ziemliche Entt√§uschung. Dieser Film war so gew√∂hnlich wie jede andere Doku, und das Format erinnerte an BBC oder n-tv Reportagen.

Weiters wirkte der Inhalt auf mich nicht sonderlich interessant. Zumindest nicht auf die Weise, auf die er hier pr√§sentiert wurde. Nat√ºrlich ist Petits Geschichte  eine sensationelle Story, aber um sie zu erz√§hlen h√§tten zehn Minuten gereicht - so wird versucht k√ºnstlich Spannung zu erzeugen, ohne jedoch damit gro√üartig erfolgreich zu sein.",Man on Wire

4,"Man on wire is an excellent documentary that tells, with a great humor interest captivation and smartness, the inside story of the great artist Philippe petit and its group of friends.The documentary portrays very well the the feelings of the group the fear and the incredible adventures and goals they achieved together.Far from using the common tricks editors and directors use in general to make this kind of stories appealing and spectacular(by using special effect and extraordinary scenes).The director only uses the available footage of  ""the artistic crime of the century"" without adding anything more than the passion and the feeling of the participants.And it works ,The effect is very minimalist yet fascinating.We end up drowned in this incredible story which tells the story of a man dancing on a wire.",Man on Wire
2,Worth a watch!  Philippe Petit accomplished something truly amazing.  His personality as a performer gets old though.  He obviously craves attention and thinks he's the bees knees.  A little humility is all I ask.,Man on Wire
3,"""Man on Wire"" feels less like a routine documentary than it does a heist film detailing the events before, during and after a risky venture. It's slightly too short and some scenes play out in an overly dramatic fashion, but it certainly is well-made and undeniably intriguing. Plus, its themes of a man attempting to accomplish a near-impossible dream of his makes it rather enlightening.",Man on Wire
4,"A truly fascinating and gripping story, but also an insight into how passion can drive a dream, as crazy as it may seem.",Man on Wire
5,It was pure amazingness; ive never seen a better documentary than this,Man on Wire
4,"""Man on Wire"" is an ethereal, breathless experience. Essentially structured as a heist film, this glimpse into the life of Phillippe Petit and his amazing journey to the top of the World Trade Center towers is majestic and exciting. The images shown here are simply jaw-dropping, and the film stands as an epic and beautiful tribute to the triumph of the human spirit. While there are no direct references to the tragedy of September 11th, 2001, these events inevitably hang heavy over all that transpires, and it's the things left unsaid that invite a quiet respect and solemn beauty to the film.

The story of Petit also stands as a cautionary tale, highlighting the damage that unrestrained passion and commitment to ones art can have. It's when the film shifts into this realm that it runs into problems, as certain head scratching statements seem to come out of left field. The carefully constructed narrative suddenly feels devoid of context, and the graceful tone of everything that came before starts to dissipate. Still, the entire experience is incredible; this is really one of the most compelling documentaries I've seen. Highly recommended.",Man on Wire
5,"This wasn't like watching a documentary (in the best way possible). Beautifully shot, perfect music, a great balance between the seriousness of the event and the hilarious moments in between....etc. One of the best documentaries I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.",Man on Wire

4,"Before seeing this, I figured why the heck should I care about some guy who just does tightrope acts from high places? What the movie ends up being really about though, is how to realistically carry through on your dreams, no matter how ridiculous they may be. It basically informs you of the kind of structure necessary to do such a thing, whatever that thing may be. So for that, yeah. It's pretty cool.",Man on Wire
4,"An entertaining documentary about a man's art, but jumping between stories takes you out of the experience.",Man on Wire
5,"to watch Philippe achieve his spectacular dream is totally mesmerising.

5,"Captivating, perplexing documentary of a French stunt artist named Philippe Petit who takes extraordinary risks by using a tight rope to walk across from one point to another. His trials begin in France where he essentially uses simple posts to suspend the wires, gradually the heights of the pillars used. However, his hunger for risk grows as her goes to places, such as the Notre Dame building. Then, it was the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Australia. Finally, a year after they were built, the legendary Twin Towers in New York City in 1973. With the support of his peers, including a now ex-girlfriend, he attracts media attention. Interestingly, World Trade Centre walk yields unsatisfying results for him and his peers. Fascinating to every degree and such a bizarre, dangerous obsession that did not result in Petit's death. Ironically, the man's last name is clearly not a way of describing his level of risk nor heights for which he single-handedly crossed. Incredibly impressive chronicle!",Man on Wire

4,"Best documentary of 2008? Inspiring story, captivating man, awe inspiring scenes ... what more could you want?",Man on Wire
3,"As a documentary it is quite good, though the dramatized events do take away from it a bit.  What I found amazing is the archival footage of the World Trade Center buildings being constructed.  We have all spent soooo much time since 2001 seeing the remnants of the Twin Towers, and it's almost difficult to imagine a time BEFORE they were constructed.  If nothing else this movie (and the animated short on the DVD) are a love story to the majesty and beauty of the former World Trade Center buildings.  And it does not take away from Phillipe Petit, and his incredible ability, crazy as he may be.  Good movie.  Incredible story.",Man on Wire
2,"I don't know - somehow the guy bugged me.  I admit he was a great tight rope walker, but I didn't like how he treated his friends.",Man on Wire

Very suspenseful, very well done little film; the commentators were excellent and the footage was much better than I had expected.

2,"With a single subject, one would think Man on Wire would be as taut as the piece of cable Philippe Petit once walked on.  Alas, it is not.  The dramatic narrative of Man on Wire bends and tragically breaks under the weight of it's ungainly length, with each sadly uncut minute (After about 35 minutes into the movie) acting as so many straws to a back that can't sustain it.
Despite the intriguing storyline, haunting footage of the construction of the original WTCs, colorful characters, a taut and spot-on score, and an idea inconceivable to most, Man on Wire ultimately fails to deliver an effective movie, because it tries to deliver too much, interview too many people.  An hour in, and this documentary lost all its carefully developed dramatic tension, so much so, that this interviewer did not make it through the entire first viewing.  
Ideally 50 minutes long, one wishes someone would have whispered into the editor/director's ear, ""Less is More.""",Man on Wire

3,"All the build-up to the main event starts to drag and leaves the climax somewhat flat.  I found the footage of the Notre Dame and bridge stunts almost more fascinating than the WTC stunt.  Man On Wire is a good film, but more focus should have been put on the actual WTC walk which was the purpose of the film.",Man on Wire
4,Fascinating story that i had never heard of before.Well told truly remarkable characters make this a joy to watch,Man on Wire
5,"Will you be willing to die for your dream? Will you risk your life for achieving the thing you desire the most? Well Philippe Petit says: ""If I die, what a beautiful death! To die in the exercise of your passion."" And that's what impressed me the most about this documental, his determination. Also, Petit's audicity and exhilarating personality make of this movie a funny and exciting adventure. There is passion, friendship, love, suspense and funny moments. But, above all there is a dream. How many of us would risk everything and walk in the edge of an abyss to achieve our goals? Only a few, that's for sure.",Man on Wire
4,"I love these kinds of feature length documentaries about something totally isolated in film genre and unique. In this case, a very charismatic and quirky french man obsessed with wire walking. This documentary pays attention to detail in every aspect of this subject, featuring history, footage, interviews and beautitiful imagery. In particular there is something quite magnificent about a man lying down on a wire 1/4 of a mile up in the air. The only disapointment is after all the build up there was no actual movie footage of his twin towers walk",Man on Wire
0,Documentary are a sad excuse for a movie they require no imagination no skill simply reenacting events but with your own details snobby movie critics need to start being honest when you watch a movie and your bored don't say it was breath taking and beautiful because you wanna sound artsy.

I loved the lesson of take only half and leave half so the species can continue without harm. It is an Indigenous message likely handed down and a truism that if ignored will end in our peril.

Macedonia is like anywhere else in Europe for most people but there remains a large minority of the population who live this earthy existence. What amazes me is just how diverse their life skills are and how brilliantly improvisational they are. They approach nature with no fear and are at one with heir surroundings whereas most of us all n the modern world would be lost without the usual trappings. I'd last a couple of days in my own in the wild whereas yo this lot it's just easy. Reminds me how much health and safety has contorted our perceptions of risk‚Ä¶much for the worse.

4,"Now available on Sky Documentaries is North Macedonia's first Oscar nominated film, and also the first ever to be nominated in both the Foreign Film and Documentary Feature categories, and quite rightly so. Shot over 3 years, Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov edit down over 400 hours of footage to produce a film where its visual imageries are allowed to do all the talking. Adopting a purely observational style without any musical score or narration, and where conversations between characters are pretty minimal, it manages to uncover organically a clear, poignant and powerful narrative that plays out like a scripted indie drama. Hatidze Muratova is a natural bee-keeper who lives off the land, and in particular the honeycomb, under a simple rule of half for her and half for the bees. With her ailing 85-years-old mother, they are practically the entirety of their tiny, remote village until a family of nomads arrives. At first, she cherishes their company but things soon take a turn when their different philosophies and ways of life begin to threaten her bees and her livelihood. Hatidze, looking like the embodiment of Mother Earth, and her more considerate and mindful way with nature contrasts vividly with her neighbours' callous treatment of the environment and the way they take things for granted. However, it never passes any judgement and always maintains an objective and sympathetic perspective on the nomads' struggles, right up to its sad but elegantly poignant end. Made with a tremendous amount of craftsmanship and patience, this beautiful film not only captures normal daily life in its most natural state and weaves small individual scenes together into one thoroughly fascinating and emotional journey, but also makes an urgent argument towards an increasingly critical re-evaluation of mankind's relationship with his Environment.",Honeyland
4,It's a nice watch. Amazing if you take into account the chance of the story that was created there by chance. Makes me want to get some honey.,Honeyland

5,Great reality TV.  Well done.,Honeyland
4,"I never heard of this documentary film until I saw it was Oscar nominated. It's a Macedonian piece of work and features a lonely lady that takes care of her dying mother. She lives isolated - completely alone in the wilderness and makes a living collecting honey. She has done it for years and she is known for her honey's taste. She takes trips to Skopje to sell it to market sellers or attend gatherings with other gypsy-like people. When a family on wheels put's up a honey farm few meters away from her place things turn nasty. The bees are in rivalry and the owners of the new farm don't know anything about this line of work. Hatidze, our protagonist helps them out, still - showing what a very kind woman she is.

This does not feel like a documentary. It looks splendid and crisp and the way the story is developing seem scripted and practiced. 400 hour of footage collected from a crew that originally where after principal photography. The film is not about honey, the bees, the chase for money, Hatidze or her new neighbours and they're terrible child rasing techniques. This is a reflection on humans inpact on earth, nature and wildlife. Treat it carefully or pay the price. 

It makes you reflect and drift away, kind of feeling lucky you are not still living in the 1880's like this woman practically does. A very good documentary not to be missed.

4,"I went to see HONEYLAND without knowing much about it. It turned out to be a fascinating, riveting documentary. The filmmakers spent three years filming at different times over the period, often by living in a tent near the home of Hatidzhe Muratova, the bee-keeper (I prefer to call her a beekeeper rather than a bee hunter - I think it is more accurate). I learned so much from watching this documentary. But it's not just about information. The film is a story about the tensions and effects that are caused by a nomadic farming family who move in to the area with their cattle. When they discover the potential to make money from selling honey, they decide to start beekeeping themselves with some very troubling results for Hatidzhe.

HONEYLAND is beautifully filmed. The story naturally unfolds without interviews or commentary. It just happens. And it's very engaging. This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Check it out if it's showing near you.",Honeyland
3,"I am never going to be as entertained by a documentary, especially one that depicts such difficult lifestyles.  However, this film was beautiful to watch and masterfully executed.",Honeyland
3,"Honeyland is a unique glimpse into a world I doubt any of us have ever seen before. This makes it compelling for that reason alone. However I don't think it's totally successful in its making, but there are certainly elements that stayed with me. The film is a true fly on the wall documentary with zero narration. It concerns itself with Hatidze, a wild beekeeper in the remote mountains of North Macedonia. The camera follows her as she goes about her daily routine. Collecting honey, looking after her elderly and sick mother. Sometimes venturing into Skopje to sell her honey at the market. Her dwelling is basic to say the least, very spartan with no electricity or running water, and only an infrequently working radio for entertainment. The scenes of her and the bees are beautifully filmed, giving us a true sense of her careful craft. Then a feral family of nomadic Turks moves in next door. They have cattle, which they treat badly and this is severely off putting. They also buy their own colony of bees and this is where things go wrong. They don't follow her natural practices, wreaking havoc on the delicate balance of her ecosystem. It's a salient reminder of the dangers to the natural order of things by humans only chasing a quick dollar. But it's also hard to watch, some scenes can be quite distressing. But the finish and end of this film are quite beautiful, making for a worthwhile experience. I do think though that narration would have helped to frame the film and make it more accessible. Fleshing out the story I think could have elevated the film to greatness.",Honeyland

Documentaries usually show how things are, but they rarely convey any allegoric messages. Sadly, some people have missed the most important message here.
This piece of art completely shatters the current perspective of how documentaries should be structured, and completely awakens emotions and thoughts in it's viewers.
In my opinion, it deserved an Oscar, even though it received many other world-recognized cinematic awards.",Honeyland

3,"Honeyland has a good message and a good story, but is bogged down by its direction. This documentary has some very important themes regarding the environment. The film also has a very compelling story on paper. However, the execution did leave a lot to be desired. The film has mentor pacing issues, which is a big problem when the film is less than 90 minutes. The direction was too easygoing and meandering. The film could‚Äôve used more focus. Still, I was compelled due to the stunning nature footage and the story being played out. Overall, I feel like this film could‚Äôve been excellent. Instead, we settle for a movie with a lot of potential that just ends up being fine.",Honeyland

2,"Casting a light on an overlooked profession in rapid decline, Honeyland is a documentary made from 400 hours of footage, condensed into just under an hour and a half. It's a story about the environment, family, conflicts with invaders and trying to survive on the fringe of society. It's made in the style of a fly-on-the-wall documentary, but it lacks a lot of the urgency that those often contain. Much of the footage is made up of mundane conversations between our lead and the nomadic neighbours that appear on her property. I'd like to know what kind of things they edited out, considering how uninteresting much of the footage they left in turns out to be. It spoken to many people and is frequently cited as profound, but to me it was like watching your annoying neighbours argue for 90 minutes. A revealing glimpse into how some people live, but nothing that you'd miss out on if you chose another film instead.",Honeyland
5,Amazingly shot. And what a beautiful story. I was sad when the family left because of her relationship with one of their sons. Such a beautiful final scene too.,Honeyland
4,Powerful and real. Really makes me realize how blessed I am and selfish I can be when I forget that. We in W.E.I.R.D. countries get distracted in our bubble and forget what life for most people actually looks like. This film will remind you and that's definitely a good thing.,Honeyland
3,"As most of you know I'm not a huge documentary fan, but I had to check this out because a few people I know had told me to check this one out. Honeyland is about a lady named Hatidze Muratova who is the last known bee farmer in Europe. She takes what she needs from the bee's and makes very little money in her remote little area of land that she calls home. She lives with her incredibly old and ill mother and life for the most part is pretty by the numbers. Hatidze harvests the bees and takes care of the hives, she sells honey to the city which is a four hour trek for her by foot and train, then she returns takes care of her mom and then for the most part that's about it. Then one day some nomadic farmers (aka gypsies) move in close to Hatidze and begin to sort of destroy her way of life. The documentary does a great job of showing the contrast between the two where as Hatidze is very much one with nature the other family is very destructive and at times don't seem to care what happens to the land. I enjoyed this one for the most part, but I will say it's a bit slow paced and as someone who doesn't enjoy documentaries too much I had to watch this one in a number of sittings. For anyone interested give it a look if you have Hulu it is streaming on there.",Honeyland
5,"I was enthralled by this movie from the opening scene. Hatidze Muratova is not an actress but the very same person portrayed in the film. She, and her life, are what made it so good.",Honeyland
5,This movie is Oscar nominated for best documentary and foreign film.  It is quite unlike any movie I have ever seen.  A 50 something woman is eking out a living raising bees for their honey for herself and invalid mother.,Honeyland
5,"Remarkable... and highly recommended.  The narrative of the film is so strong and compelling, it's hard to believe that it is strictly a documentary.  However, all of this is easier to understand when you know that ""Honeyland"" was shot over 3 years and the brilliant filmmakers had over 400 hours of footage in the can to create this work and shape the story.

Much more that I could add but for me, in the end, this work is a cri de couer about how the capitalistic system (even in North Macedonia) values short-term profits over the long term, i.e. preserving the only planet we live on.",Honeyland
5,"""HONEYLAND"" AND GRETA THURNBERG - THE NEW HEROES OF OUR TIME

The two phenomenon have been a subject to a similar bipolar division of reactions in the public where some glorified them, and others criticized them up to a point of hatred. This fact alone, proves that they have already accomplished their goal, they have had an impact on the world regarding subjects which societies, leaders, and people in general tend to persistently ignore.

I hope that we are entering a new era, where we leave behind the glorification of petty subject for plain fun and diminishing current events. Our societies by now have placed the highest values on athletes, famous actors, modern aristocracy... I hope the time has come for ordinary people, ""anonymous"" like Greta Thunberg and ""Honeyland"" with the authors and the main protagonist - Hatidze will be the new driving force in societies where with their influence they will cause radical societal changes and become the new heroes of a new era.

Hatizde, the last beekeeper of wild bees in Europe, admires everyone with universal values which we recognize in every culture, religion, philosophical and spiritual doctrine in the world, that most likely have been passed down and perfected from one generation to another. Respect for nature, humility, moderation, and compassion are silently reflected in the background through the entire course of the movie. Hatidze enjoys the companion of the bees, simply loving them, selflessly sharing the honey with them, half for people, half for them, - an extraordinary example of sustainability.

The fact that for the first time in the history of the Oscars a documentary is entering the competition in the category of best international movie, where all of the other nominees are based on fiction, is not surprising. Thanks to the authors for the mastery of making a documentary into art, that you literary take in as a feature film.

It's also interesting to notice that an unusual moment in the movie is experienced diametrically opposite. Hatidze's call for the bees, Maat, mat, mat, mat which some viewers interpreted as quote: ""When I heard her mumbling something, I turned it off..."" While others like the Dutch movie critic Belinda van de Graf experienced that moment as, quote ""Hatidze is singing to the bees...""

I personally experienced that moment as utterly poetic, a feeling I would like to explain further. The very call from Hatidze to the bees Maaaat, mat, mat, mat has its roots in the word matica - queen bee (lat. mater, matrix). It's particularly interesting that Hatidze is usually speaking ottoman Turkish language, but the word matica is also a Macedonian term, indicating an archaic word that surpasses today's languages. It's inevitable to ask a simple question. What magic is engaged in the queen, a simple insect, recognizing those words as a friendly call from a human, where according to Darwin's Theory of evolution these two species are so profoundly different?

Namely, when I first saw the trailer with awe last spring, the moment when Hatidze called the bees with the call Maaaat, mat, mat, mat is a moment that became so familiar and close to me. I suddenly remembered my childhood where in a mountain village in eastern Macedonia, a grandmother explained how they used to keep bees in woven baskets, identical like the ones Hatidze uses. In short, among other things was the recognition of the call to the queen Maaaat, mat, mat, mat quietly gathering the bees around and communicating with them. In that moment the pieces of the puzzle came together and I realized that when Hatidze is singing the ""mantra"", she is identifying herself with the queen bee, taking on her role, calling, gathering, communicating just like the queen would, Hatidze becomes the queen bee. An incredible symbiosis between human and nature.

With this story I want to express my admiration of the movie, to the authors as well as to the audience. They have acknowledged the fact that there is no successful or unsuccessful life, no important or unimportant human, no significant or insignificant story, all lives are successful, unrepeatable experiences. This movie casted a light on a seemingly simple life, and uplifted and glorified a supposedly ordinary human, which turned out to be deeply ethical, pure, loving, towards people and nature alike, and simply beautiful, just like the movie itself.",Honeyland
5,Incredible documentary that plays as if the real life characters were actors. This film crew deserves every award they have earned.,Honeyland
4,"A documentary with such a solid narrative, colorful characters, gorgeous visuals and a clear message, it plays like a ""real"" movie. As we watch this obnoxious family move next door to and terrorize a serene beekeeper and her ailing mom, we realize it's a microcosm of how toxic capitalism destroys craftsmanship and honestly fulfilling work.",Honeyland
5,Fantastic!  Are we western civilization the Nomads?,Honeyland
4,This documentary is really interesting. The story of a beekeeper in a remote area of Macedonia and her relationship with the nomadic family that moves in next door.  It is  a slow film but the people are so interesting and the photography so good that it keeps your attention. I really was wondering how the heck they were able to film this project.,Honeyland
5,Great documentary I definitely recommend it,Honeyland
5,"Amazing watch, it is clearly a hard documentary to film and keeps the watcher guessing if it's real or not, but it is all real and very astonishing to watch it develop. 10/10",Honeyland
4,"Fascinating world and skilled storytelling, superb",Honeyland
4,"The beautiful, well-made, and thorough 'Honeyland' is a documentary that comprised over three years and 100s of hours of footage into a tightly wound 90 minute documentary.  This is why i love docs.  You'd never a think a film about Macedonian bee keepers would be interesting or necessary, but you'd be wrong.  It's subtle yet intense and must viewing for all the cinephiles out there.  Final Score:  8.4/10",Honeyland
4,"It is one of those film that leaves you thinking there is a reason for the cinema to carry on in our new age of the digital world. Far from being just a film, this masterpiece is an anthropological study of merit. It captures our human experience with ourselves, the closed ones, enemies, nature and existence all in ninety minutes. Personally, I couldn't help but draw from the universality of this motion pictures a comparison with Lord of the Flies. But instead of having fictional characters in a fictional setting, best films have people instead of murderers or those known as actors. The film puts Hollywood for a good use of disposal after a very spicy curry and chutney night.",Honeyland
3,"This film shows us two perspectives, one is a woman living with respect for nature taking time to understand, nurture and give back. The other side is a bugling family who take, mistreat, misuse and noisily destroy the environment. It was like a horrid fairytale.",Honeyland
5,"Exelent movie!
You will think about Hatidze for a loong, long time!",Honeyland
3,"In this documentary a Macedonian woman tries to use ancient bee keeping techniques to live off of the land. A Turkish farming family from a nomadic background become her understudies, but come into conflict with her and her give when they try to put a modern spin on her methods. For reference, North Macedonia, where the documentary mostly takes place is on the Northern border of Greece and west of Turkey. It is shown with the original Turkish audio.",Honeyland
5,"The documentary of the year, the Macedonian production ""Honeyland"" is brilliantly directed by Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov, and exquisitely photographed by Fejmi Daut and Samir Ljuma, all of whom deserve any honors they score. Hatidze Muratova is a never-married woman in her fifties who is working as a beekeeper to support herself and her dying mother Nazife. To call their relationship dysfunctional seems trite, but its push and pull amid a hardscrabble setting ¬† recalls ""Grey Gardens"" (1975), minus any Grand Guignol grandstanding on the filmmakers' part. When a Turkish family arrives and attempts to beat her at her own game, Hatidze's process, her delicate and expert planning, are knocked off track. The film manages to be stunningly beautiful while documenting a dying tradition so carefully it feels at times we are watching it die before our eyes, in real time. Hatidze is an open book, and her struggle becomes ours; one we can walk away from, but one she must go on enduring. You'll never forget her, and it should not be lost on anyone watching that the way she depends upon bees is a metaphor for the planet's reliance on that invaluable species.",Honeyland
5,"The best documentary of 2019! Honeyland is an achievement in human storytelling. The film's subject is magical and so full of love, life, hope and perseverance. Incredibly heartwarming, a must see!",Honeyland
5,"OSCAR for Best picture. Please!. This film is the best wonderful and most significant film I've ever seen. I cried, it touched my heart, the movie was so beautiful and perfect, poetic, many lessons have been learned from this excellent film, .. and I hope everyone knows this film in the future and watch it.",Honeyland
4,"Honeyland offers an intimate, meticulous look into the beekeeping tradition in Macedonia through many very interesting scenes, and even some heartwarming ones. It's slower in pace, but phenomenally shot throughout, very well directed and feeling entirely authentic in its subject matter.",Honeyland
5,"All I can say is WOW.
Never thought that such a simple movie/documentary was going to be this freaking good. I recommend for everyone to watch it. 10/10. Best documentary I've seen all year.",Honeyland
5,"We are all Hussein Sam, destroying the planet. Destroying all around, wanting to make some money. A phenomenal movie that must be watched. And .... Hatidze - we love you <3",Honeyland
4,"Good but super sad. I mean I didn't expect this coming from a bee documentary. What touched me most was the relationship with her mother. The sacrifice she made for her mother cannot be described in words. It makes me question if anything can be done for her, but it seems like she will live out her existence just as we see her doing when the documentary ended.",Honeyland
5,"Stunningly beautiful cinematography and touching story ... yet is a documentary, which simply adds to the stun factor. If Hollywood TRIED to make this movie (which it in no way could or would) it would cost about a billion dollars.",Honeyland
2,"Trouble in National Geographica.  (Mz Blobbo like it, though.)",Honeyland
5,"""One half for me, one half for you.""

3 years. 400+ hours of footage. My 2nd viewing. Yet I am still at a loss for words at how a film like this is even possible.

It somehow manages to present a grounded narrative, a parable of rural life, and a kind environmental message, all quietly captured through observational lens and intimate scope. You will witness everything from a cow giving birth to the near-drowning of a child (which, while brief, is very difficult to watch). The editing and fly-on-the-wall filmmaking style is superb.

A humbling and unforgettable film. Do not miss.",Honeyland
5,Perfect. Many lessons to be learned about how we treat our world.,Honeyland
5,"It's the golden nectar of cinema.  If you didn't fully perceive it's message the first viewing.  Watch it again.  Life simply unfolds in a nearly abandoned village in the hills of Macedonia.  Where the remaining inhabitant takes care of her dying mother while tending to her life long tradition of bee keeping.  The movie emphasizes what really matters in life in a simple, realistic and unconventional storyline.",Honeyland
3,Fascinating glimpse into a corner of the world I‚Äôd never have seen. The story is terribly sad.,Honeyland
5,The best documentary I have ever seen! I love it!,Honeyland
1,"There are a lot of images showing animal cruelty and no one is talking about that which is really disturbing. I respect the main character's story and everything, but the animal cruelty is unforgivable. It made me sick. I can only hope that no animal was hurt while making the movie but i really doubt that.",Honeyland
5,Wow and we think our lives are hard. Sleeping in a cave like home. Taking care of her 85 year old mother. Walking everywhere. Living off selling honey from wild bee‚Äôs.,Honeyland
4,A fine movie - a great job of cinematic storytelling! As they say - good things really do come in small packages.,Honeyland
4,"As a long-time movie lover, this was more than seeing a movie for me. It made me want to go visit Hatidz. I cried for a long time after the end. This is a microscopic view of what's happening on the planet.  I wish I could give it 10 stars.",Honeyland
4,"Fascinating, up close look at this woman and her life.",Honeyland
5,"This is an exquisite film in every way.   It captures (and makes us understand) a time and a place with superb cinematography, tells an important story without ""telling"" it, and you can't help loving the central real-life character.  It is stunningly conceived and created.  I hope more people take advantage of its all-too-limited showings.",Honeyland

5,Beautiful movie. A must see.,Honeyland
1,"Relentlessly depressing and just plain exhausting.  It was obvious how this would end (not well) from the start.  Yet another ""tragedy of the commons"" redo.   Yet we were stuck following that painful path without  a break or any hope that it would end differently this time.",Honeyland

0,You need No-Doz to keep you awake and then a case of antidepressants after seeing this movie. How could anyone rate this movie highly. Absolutely HORRIBLE. What's the message? it's hard being poor or try to do anything to get out of this shithole country,Honeyland
5,"Had never seen anything like this...incredible story of a woman whose world is so different from mine...gave me some great perspective...beautifully shot...it seems like it was dramatized, but learning it had been shot over three years proves to me it is indeed a documentary. The woman‚Äôs resilience is so impressive. I would like to see how this impressive woman‚Äôs life will be three years from now.",Honeyland
5,Beautiful and heart wrenching.,Honeyland

3,A powerful moving story about resilience and perseverance. I am still thinking about the movie the next day.,Honeyland
5,"I‚Äôm a documentary lover of strange and wondrous topics, but I have never seen a more awe-inspiring portrait of a brave soul. The camera work is stunning, as kind to the landscape and the bees as it is to the incredible stars ‚Äì ‚ÄìHatidze Muratova, and her mother who are beyond beautiful. I am blown away by their love and by Hatidze‚Äôs reverence for the bees. Should be seen by anyone who ever complains about anything or film lovers with open hearts.",Honeyland
5,This is a most amazing movie.  An intended documentary of nature and one person's tie to it becomes an epic story of conflict between a woman trying to live in harmony with nature and those eager to exploit it.  Hatidze's care for her aged and dying mother amidst the conflict brings tears to one's eyes.  How can my friends see this movie?,Honeyland

5,"Sound Check

There's people that prefer the drafting board to computers, prefer a typewriter to word-processing software, prefer film to digital cameras, etc. The list is extensive and the people on it are usually dismissed and eventually forgotten as technology moves forward. CGI creates better special effects; digital images can be deleted without wasting film; and Computer Aided Drafting and Manufacturing creates better, more accurate products. However, the case for analog over digital methods in music continues to be made. Musicologist Dave Grohl brings this debate to the court of public opinion in ""Sound City."" Called to the witness stand is a variety of fellow artists from the 60's to present which includes Paul McCartney, Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty, Neil Young, John Fogerty, Barry Manilow, Rick Springfield, et al. All these participants not only testify to their in experience with the analog studio, but also the influences and differences of digital over analog methods on music culture. It's made apparent early on that this documentary is more than just a ""day in the life"" of musicians and how they created the art we enjoy as Dave later affirms:  
""It all started with this idea that I wanted to tell the story of the board. The conversation became something much bigger. Like . . .  in this age of technology, where you simulate or manipulate anything, how do we retain that human element . . .? How do we keep music to sound like people? That feeling that I got when I was young, Oh, I could that too.""

And so the case is made that it's the analog imperfections that retains the human quality much like hand-made furniture as compared to the mass produced. But the film is not a total dis on technology. It's stated quite clearly that it was the ""Neve"" sound board that much homage is paid to including an interview with sound engineer Rupert Neve himself. For although this was the pinnacle of technology, it was still analog technology. As the film's humble narrator/producer conducts a multi leveled, pro/con journey spanning many decades of music, as digital methods continued to penetrate the music culture. In all these examples there are those who reject it, those who embrace it, and those who find a middle ground for old and new technologies to coexist in their vocation. Some prefer a set of drums and others use an electronic drum machine.  Eventually, Sound City couldn't compete with the digital world where artists steadily became more like computer music ""file makers"" rather than instrument trained musicians. Through many examples we are shown that in music, in spite of the advances in recording and producing technology, many musicians can preserve the ""human"" quality with state of the art ""analog"" technologies. 
Dave never forgot where he came from. This was the impetus for making this film and the reason for preserving the Neve board which now resides in his private studio. He waxes some heavy philosophy but never comes off preachy which could easily turn any movie into a ""vanity project.""  In fact he comes off very altruistic with his many homages to the staff and studio where he cut his first album with Nirvana.",Sound City
4,Such a cool documentary. I'm a sucker for these type of docs or movies on music and just to see all this amazing rock history was awe inspiring.,Sound City
5,"An entertaining, sometimes moving look a slice of rock & roll history. And Dave Grohl. Lots of Dave Grohl.",Sound City
2,"The first time I saw this documentary, I was thrilled. I thought it did an exceptional job speaking the messages it needed to convey, namely the closing of Sound City, the stories of the records and the people involved, and digital technology's takeover. At the time it seemed the documentary captured the feeling of being in the studio with the people making what would become the soundtrack to this movie fairly well, and overall I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Sound City as it was told.

However, for me, this documentary movie did not age as well as I hoped. After not watching it for a long time and then coming back to it, the documentary, while still technically superb and appearing historically accurate, came across to me as, in some parts, showing some older artists that are preaching cynical opinions about the current music coming out today. These opinions wouldn't be so problematic if they didn't show up as often as they do, but it gets distracting, especially if someone like myself isn't fully on board with the opinions which are shared. 

In addition to the opinions themselves, the people in the movie sometimes back up their points of view and the general opinion of the documentary in ways that either mean very little or are unclear. A common theme in the movie is that an artist must ""play from their heart"" and ""be real"" to be any good. This is one such example of something that on the surface sounds like it has the same universal meaning to everyone, but after digging a little deeper does not really have any set definition. To clarity, one person could theoretically define being ""real"" as making or playing what sounds good to them, whether or not sounding good contradicts the rest of the  opinionated points made by the documentary.

Another example of something that has little substance and also backs up the point I made earlier about the documentary focusing too much on older artists preaching about what is wrong with music today is the comment by Trent Reznor from around the middle of the movie:

""Now that everyone is empowered with these tools to create stuff, has there been a lot more great shit coming out? Not really. You still have to have something to do with those tools. You should really try to have something to say.""

The reason this quote is being placed in this review is I found it to be the most prominent of all the quotes I could use that combines subjectivity with lack of meaning, and it therefore illustrates my point. To quickly break this down, the first half is regarding the music coming out (from where and what outlet, exactly?) not being great. Whether or not current music is great is an opinion, yet Trent is stating it as fact. The second half of that statement can be interpreted in much the same way that ""playing from your heart""  and ""being real"" can, which is completely dependent on the person.

Not only does the meaninglessness show exclusivity towards certain artists, but it can come across as discouraging, not inspiring, because it implies not doing something ""for real,"" or ""faking it,"" whatever that means, indicates you shouldn't even start to make music. That is a message I am close to certain Dave Grohl likely doesn't want to send.

The third part of it, however, is the most well done because the mood lightens up, the history has been covered, and the opinions and their reasons for the most part quiet down. These factors, coupled with the fact that watching the artists in the studio nearly gives the impression that you are in the studio with them due to the way it was filmed makes this part of the documentary the most fun for me to watch. 

Bottom Line: 

I am a fan of Dave Grohl's music and can appreciate this documentary as a great entrance for him into directing. I still have respect for Dave Grohl and his documentary on Sound City because it is technicaly well done and is fascinating to watch if you don't know about the studio, Sound City, because it gets the historical message across. But if it's goal was to change people's minds with it's opinions, I don't know how far it will get, as it certainly didn't change mine.",Sound City

4,"3.9/5

Impressive as all the guest stars may be, Sound City tends to loose itrs track towards the end as it enjoys presenting the history and the aspects of the locations but eventually doesnt really go nowhere conclusive on the matter, at least not beyond implications. However it does not take away the fact that Sound City does a great job at documenting some important history and connecting a ton of stories and little details that make the documentary even more enjoyable.",Sound City

4,"Dave Grohl must have learned a great deal from James Moll during the making of the documentary Foo Fighters: Back and Forth. This time Grohl not only tells the story, but steps behind the camera as the director. Grohl shows skill and makes a seemingly insignificant story interesting. The film tells the tragic, yet glorious tale of the Sound City Studios in Los Angeles. Against the odds, a seemingly a rundown sound studio in a former manufacturing facility produced several classic rock n roll albums. Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Young, Rick Springfield, and Slipknot recorded watershed albums there. The film walks through the formation and history of the studio and explains a great deal about the process of making a recorded. It also comments on how different the process is today, not necessarily for the better. It is almost a perfect documentary, but the end drifts into the making a reunion album involving collaborations of various artists who recorded at Sound City. The resulting music from that album is nice, but watching the making of the reunion album is less interesting. It is still a very well made documentary with tons of great interviews. Any fan of rock music from the 70s-90s will love it.",Sound City

Just gearing up for ""montage of heck""",Sound City
4,Grohl and Monroe hit it right. Big time.,Sound City
3,"Written, produced and directed by Foo Fighters frontman and Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. This is a documentary of two halves, first it tells the story of one of the most famous recording studios in Los Angeles, and the roster of stars who made best selling records there, and secondly, it's also celebrates a unique mixing desk that captured the sound, and how the desk would be used once again for the soundtrack. Sound City Studios was based in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. It opened in 1969, but it wasn't very state of the art, and it had once been a factory, as a result, it was very run down in need of modernising. However, the studio did have one very big ace up it's sleeve, and that was it had a Neve 8028 analog mixing console, which captured a deep, rich sound on all the recordings, and it attracted all the very best musical acts from the 1970's, right up until the studios closed in 2011. Acts including Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Nirvana and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Grohl bought the Neve mixing desk, and he invites a few friends to his place to jam... You can tell that this is a passion project, but you can tell that Grohl has real interest and passion in the studios in question, and despite it being very run down and in need of a good clean, the studio had character and a quirky charm. But, what brought people to the studio was the Neve console, which comes into it's own when Grohl records with the likes of Stevie Nicks and Paul McCartney, which gives the story some closure.",Sound City
4,I don't really know anything about music. ...,Sound City
5,"That was fantastic. Apparently I owe a whole lot of my musical taste and the existence of some of my favourite albums to Sound City - a recording studio and the custom ordered Neve sound board. Analog and unforgiving, if you couldn't play or sing, there was nothing to hide behind and no way to make you sound like something you weren't.

There really are three parts to this documentary. The history of the thing, the invasion of the digital age and how that changed things forever when it came to how albums were recorded, and the re use of the equipment. I remember liking a Dave Grohl and Paul McCartney song that managed to run away with a Grammy despite no one having heard of it and it was off an album that Dave Grohl and company made with the Neve board. Yeah, I may have just gone and bought that album.

If you're a music lover, specially one of bands like Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Nine Inch Nails, and and whole bunch of other artists (seriously, the amount of hit records this place has is astounding) you'll love it. It's a great film to feel nostalgic too as much as sad and hopeful about. Highly recommended.",Sound City

4,A very good look at how rock and roll was the cornerstone of a musical movement that changed a generation. Dave Grohl has pieced together a great documentary about a studio that produced some of the music industry's most infamous bands and some of theiro most infamous albums. Any music lover will enjoy Sound City and will appreciate the work and dedication that Grohl has put into this film. A music see for rock music fans.,Sound City

3,An interesting look at the inside of a few rockers way of life. A refreshing emphasis is placed on quality and skill. Comments from Neil young  are on point and overall you can see what Grohl is trying to achieve. Listening to Paul McCartney just walk into the studio with no plans and jam with Grohl is kind of special in its own right. Influential people doing what they love.,Sound City

3,"Good start, mediocre finish. I have the utmost respect for Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins, and it's probably bucket list material to see Foo Fighters in concert. So that they're in this and doing their thing is only a plus.

Great story: this shitty little studio where some of the greatest songs of all-time are recorded. So that's pretty interesting and you get a little behind-the-music stuff with some of those artists. 

Where the movie strays is after the studio closes and Dave buys the board. That story is still great, but the final 30 minutes or so are just musicians jamming out in Dave's new studio with the old board. If I knew the songs maybe it would be more interesting, but I'm not much into artists just jamming together. Still, I love my music and there are some good artists in there.",Sound City

4,"Fans of Fleetwood Mac and Nirvana would have heard many of the anecdotes contained in Sound City before, but will still enjoy hearing them here from the people who were there to witness music history being made. More than that, this film is a story of a studio whose influence deserves to be remembered and a lament of the loss of producing an album as a recording of performance in our digital age.

The film begins with its director, Dave Grohl (former Nirvana drummer, Foo Fighters singer, song-writer, guitarist and many other appearances besides), recounting his first road trip to Sound City, relating the power of music to transport disaffected kids away from their reality, and the expectations of Sound City as a promised land, a place where troubled journeys end and dreams come true. His first impressions though, were less than impressive. Sound City did not represent the pearly gates he imagined. Instead the place was a dump, poorly maintained with a flooding car park. And yet when you walk down the corridors you walk past the gold and platinum records that were recorded there - Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac, Rick Springfield, Neil Young, Cheap Trick, Pat Benatar and more. It was hard for him to reconcile these two early impressions.

Much of the story that follows is a retelling of the history of the studio, from its formation in 1969 to its eventual demise in 2011. Grohl centres the chronological story around some of the key albums that were recorded there - After the Goldrush, Fleetwood Mac, Working Class Dog and, of course, Nevermind - with little narration, instead allowing the key participants to describe it in their own terms. Those key participants included owner Tom Skeeter, Producers Keith Olson and Butch Vig and studio managers Paula Salvatore and Shivaun O'Brien.

The studio was founded by Joe Gotfried and Tom Skeeter in 1969, who invested early and deeply in state-of-the-art equipment, in particular, a unique Neve console. The studio's humble beginnings are related by those who were there, with the studio converted from a box factory, located in a dead part of Los Angeles with artists staying at owners and producers homes while they recorded.

Fleetwood Mac effectively formed at Sound City Studios. A chance meeting led Mick Fleetwood to Sound City and a meeting with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. The success of Fleetwood Mac drew other acts to Sound City and the late 70's saw the production of records by Santana, Grateful Dead, Foreigner, Cheap Trick and others.

Similarly, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers had their first real jam at Sound City. The success of their album, followed by Rick Springfield - who was managed by Joe Gottfried and gave the Studio their biggest hit song and album so far - meant the studio was booked solid through the early 80's. But change was soon in the air.

Grohl breaks up the chronological narrative with asides on some of the key elements that made Sound City special.

First and foremost is the Neve console. Custom made and purchased at immense expense, it takes most of the credit for what drew acts to the studio, for supplying the studio's unique sound and hence for the success of the studio.


""The Neve console really embellishes things in the context of rock and roll - it's good on drums, it's good on bass, it's good on guitars... it's a pretty badass console"" - Butch Vig.

The history of pop music is filled with examples of things that should not complement each other, should not work, yet combine to produce something magical. Whether it is the voices of Agnetha and Anni-Frid in Abba or the conflicting musical tastes of the members of Fleetwood Mac. To that we must add the drum sound you get from the recording room at Sound City. The recorded sound of drums can differ from studio to studio, more so than for guitars which can be largely uniform. As a former box factory, the room was never properly designed for recording and, in the opinions of those in the film, should not work well as a room. Yet through 'luck and magic' it produced a unique and impressive drum sound.

Grohl also relates the role of the producers at Sound City, some of which worked their way up from being runners and engineers, in creating great music, making it marketable and connecting the band to their potential audience. The toughest job of the producer is to have the courage to tell rock stars when they have nothing and give advice they do not want to hear, whether that is telling Rick Springfield he needs a better guitarist to record his songs or telling Dave Grohl to use a click track while drumming.

From the mid-80's considerable change was in the air in the music industry. The development of CD's, drum machines, sequencers and other innovations were making the cost of producing a record a fraction of what it used to be and making music over-processed and over-produced. Think Whitesnake and Def Leppard. Recording became less about capturing performance and more an exercise of engineering. Sound City could not keep up and some poor investment choices during the period only hastened the decline. Keith Olsen, Sound City's main producer to this point, who still dresses like an agent from the 80's, left Sound City and founded a new studio next door more in keeping with the trend towards digital. Sound City was dead and on the verge of bankruptcy... and that's when Nirvana arrived.

Bucking the trend towards manufactured phony perfection, Nirvana sought an old-fashioned recorded performance, complete with the imperfections that make it sound real and honest. The unexpected and unprecedented success of Nevermind saved the studio from early demise. Nirvana's success generated huge interest in the studio. New acts, such as Rage Against the Machine, recorded at Sound City, inspired by the success of Nirvana and a similar impulse towards performance recording. The old method also drew older acts such as Tom Petty and Johnny Cash back to the studio.

But the dawn was false. The drive towards using new technology and software such as Pro Tools is as inevitable as the economics of the massive savings, to be enjoyed by those who do, is unavoidable. Tape manufacturers went out of business, big studios started disappearing and Sound City began selling off equipment to keep operating.

In the last section of the film we see Grohl's purchase of the Neve console at the demise of Sound City Studio and its installation at the Foo Fighter's Studio 606. In a tribute to the studio that changed their lives, we see the recording of the soundtrack to the film with Grohl and Foo Fighters members collaborating to record songs with Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield, Lee Ving, Josh Homme and others.

In what was a surreal experience for Grohl, he records a song where he plays drums with former Nirvana members Krist Novaselic on bass and Pat Smear on rhythm guitar and Butch Vig behind the console. In front of him was a left-handed, lead singer, lead guitarist. In a strange, full-circle moment, it was like he was recording with Nirvana again. Only that left-handed guitarist was not Kurt Cobain but Paul McCartney.

Though a tad long, Sound City is a very enjoyable film. Followers of Fleetwood Mac or Nirvana may have heard these anecdotes before, it is always enjoyable for fans to relive their favourite music through the words of the stars with the images and music collected here and reminisce on the way music used to be and seldom is anymore.

A theme which comes through strongly in the film is a love-hate relationship with the influence of technology in the industry. On the one hand, the large, early investment in technology was a key part of the studios early success. And it is not as if Nirvana's Nevermind album did not utilise the latest computer technology either. Trent Reznor is also held up as an example of someone who is both traditional and an avid user of the latest technology.

On the other hand, there are frequent lamentations on the modern methods of producing music on laptops, of the phoniness and unnatural-sounding perfectionism, and the loss of performance recording. McCartney also makes the point that the restrictions of the old days forced you to make difficult creative choices to make it work.

Josh Homme says of the modern world that there are 'no bookstores, no music stores and no Sound City'. It is not quite a fair comparison. Chain stores only sold books and CDs. They did not produce them. Their personnel and culture did not provide any influence onto the finished product. History will not credit them for the magic the products delivered to fans. And they will not be missed. The same cannot be said for Sound City.

3,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (out of four)

A good and entertaining ode to a music studio and a piece of studio equipment that helped change and advance the rock n' roll music of the 1970's through the 1990's.  It is a labor of love for director Dave Grohl, but it is also a soundoff to the music of the past when records were made with blood, sweat, and tears, instead of the hollow, generic pop tunes of today.

Dave Grohl from Nirvana and the Foo Fighters directs this story of Sound City Music Studio, nestled away into a drab warehouse in the San Fernando Valley outside of Los Angeles.  It is a no-frills place that looks little better than a garage, but it became the prime choice for music acts in the mid-1970's.

Famous and classic albums were recorded there including: Fleetwood Mac's self titled album & ""Rumours"", several Tom Petty albums, Rick Springfield's ""Working Class Dog"", Pat Benatar's ""Crimes of Passion"", Nirvanna's ""Nevermind"", plus records by Nine Inch Nails, Neil Young, Elton John, Rage Against the Machine, John Fogerty...etc.

If you're a fan of rock music this will be very interesting and highly enjoyable.  The last forty minutes it changes course a little and becomes a bit self indulgent, but it onlu hurts it a little.

5,"In the opening minutes of this buoyant documentary, Dave Grohl and co. gleefully rattle off the legendary artists and albums that have been associated with the titular 'Sound City' music studio: ""Tom Petty. Fleetwood Mac. Rick Springfield. Neil Young, man. Cheap Trick. The Chili Peppers. Rob Halford. Pat Benatar. Kansas. Guns N' Roses. Nine Inch Nails. Nevermind. Hot-Blooded Foreigner. Slayer. Ratt. Johnny Cash. Carl Perkins. Metallica. r.E.O Speedwagon. Michael McDonald. Mick Fleetwood. Buckhingam Nicks. Stevie Nicks. Masters of Reality. Frank Black. Brisbane. Rick Rubin. Kyuss. Weezer.""

The camera then lingers on an awed Corey Taylor, who says ""Dude, how many fucking amazing albums have been made there?"" Over the next ninety minutes or so, we find out exactly that, and more. I wish I knew more about music so that I could appreciate this film better; it will be an absolute feast for knowledgeable fans.

'Sound City' transitions from an examination of what attracted some of the greatest names in music to a nondescript, shabby studio to a wistful lamentation of how technology has taken some of the sweat and soul out of the industry. Throughout, however, the film is just bursting with a passion that you can't help but be infected by.",Sound City
4,"This is an awesome documentary by Dave Grohl, telling one of rock's coolest and more obscure stories.  If you're a fan of rock n' roll, you owe it to yourself to check this film out.",Sound City
4,So many things to like here!,Sound City
5,"If you're into music documentaries, this is a pretty solid one.  But it's also bittersweet because the studio that recorded some of the best albums ever made, is now closed due to modern and unaffordable times.   It is a reminder that great  things don't need to come from  great packages.  If you go in with an open mind beautiful things can come from run down, old, crappy, dingy looking places.  Always a shame when great businesses that produced the best things shut down for business.   Loved this.",Sound City
3,"David Grohl abuses his celebrity status to write a passionate love song about one of the most important pieces of gear in recent music history, and gets every one from Mick Fleetwood and Rick Springstein to Paul McCartney himself to sing along. But more importantly, I think it brings up an interesting question: What makes a rockstar a rockstar? When you see Paul McCartney rocking out with Nirvana as just another band member passionately improvising a song, taking and giving suggestions as an equal and just bluntly rocking out, you down right feel humbled. It¬¥s not about the fame, or even the mythology surrounding him(or them really), but about his talent, his passion, but most of all, by his moderate demeanour. From what I saw, at least for that session, he was just a guy rocking a Cigar Box 5 string guitar, doing what he loves. And that my friends, is a bloody Rockstar! A must watch for any Rock music lover.",Sound City
5,"This is an enjoyable doc for any fan of music.  Maybe if more people saw it, there would be a greater appreciation for time and effort, instead of speed and mediocrity.  There is alot of talent and some really great stories inside of this film - I would highly recommend it.",Sound City
5,Absolutely amazing! A must watch for any music fan of any genre!,Sound City
5,"This is an amazing music documentary that tells the story behind one of the more storied recording studios of the past 40 years. The people behind the studio, the musicians who frequented it and the albums that they made give us a riveting tale. Ultimately what really sets this one apart is how it documents the studio recording process. A process involving real bands and musicians creating great music organically. A process that is quickly becoming lost in this digital and technical time where perfect music is supposedly being made through computers. The only thing missing is the most important ingredient, the soul of music. This is what Sound City provided - Soul.",Sound City
5,Love watching damn good musicians create such fine music!,Sound City
3,"Dave Grohl pulls some strings and interviews most of the key artists ever to record at Sound City, including Neil Young, Metallica, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty and...erm...Barry Manilow. A decent documentary; I may have even 'discovered' a couple of 'new' bands from watching it.",Sound City
3,Lends a bit too much to the magic of the studio rather than the talent of the artists.  Otherwise- it's very entertaining.,Sound City
5,Amazing film. A must-see for music lovers.,Sound City
4,"Sound City is a Rockumentary, directed and fronted by the ever likable Dave Grohl. 

The film follows the rise, fall, resurrection and final decline of this primitive, yet much loved recording studio in Los Angeles. 

Presented in a fun, lighthearted manner, Dave Grohl not only covers the history of the studio,  but also a overview of all the bands, the everyday staff and technology throughout the ages.

Beginning in the early 1970s, we have alt county in Neil Young, soft rock with Fleetwood mac, into perm rock cheese 80's rock before grungy Nirvana and finally modern rock bands like Queens of the Stone Age. Although some of these bands you may not of heard of, others you may not like, the juxaposition of the music and storytelling of Dave Grohl makes it both interesting, fun and worthwhile. However the documentary isnt just about the bands but also the producers, engineers and production values. Throughout this a history of the technology involved is provided. The studio interfaced is explained, and how it was overlooked and neglected during the 80's when syths ruled the airwaves. The introduction of the compact disc before the death kneel/revolution of music production of ""pro tools"" and ""auto tune""

In this modern age, of X factor,  and American Idol,  when the receptionist girl says ""This is where Real Men came to make records"" you'll have to believe her.",Sound City
4,"Doc about the now-defunct recording studio that produced a wide range of hits from the 70s through the 00s, directed by Dave Grohl. The film has two distinct halves: the first documents a history of the studio, and the second is a string of session recordings from artists who worked at the studio. The first half consists entirely of interviewed talking heads; due to the format it feels rather disjointed, and could have benefitted from narration conveying a narrative thread. Still, it's a fairly absorbing little music history lesson, focusing primarily on Fleetwood Mac, Rick Springfield, Tom Petty and Nirvana, along with changes in technology and culture.

The real draw is the second half, though. It gives an insight into the process of composing in a spontaneous live format, and the personalities involved. The artists convey different approaches, and the interviews continue to provide further background. By the end you'll feel thoroughly immersed in what it takes to create great music... and there's a lot of it made right here. If you enjoyed Amadeus, you'll find similar spine-tingling buttons pushed here, despite being a totally different film.

Also, Paul McCartney still has a ridiculously powerful voice.",Sound City

4,Great documentary directed by one of the best musicians Dave Grohl.,Sound City
3,"Honestly, a pretty interesting documentary. If you're a rock enthusiast this film has a ton of historical value and from a fresh perspective. However, sometimes I am bothered by the rating scale on rottentomatoes. It most definitely is not one of the greatest films of the year.",Sound City
5,"I loved everything about this documentary. Dave Grohl just gets it. There's no posturing here, no bull, just people who love making music making music together, and looking at where it all started for Sound City. Grohl pays the respect to the place that ""changed his life forever"" as it is where Nevermind was recorded, and we all know what that did to change his life. The sense of family that comes across versus some of the more corporate and large studios is impressive, a place where Tom Petty comes in to record another album and asks what happened to the receptionist, and is sad to hear she left. Everyone involved with Sound City amazes me, from Neil Young's After the Gold Rush to Fleetwood Mac's first album with Buckingham and Nicks, to Rick Springfield, to Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine and so forth. If you're a fan of rock and roll at all, please watch this.",Sound City
5,Simply the best Doc I have seen this year.,Sound City
4,"A warm love letter to a studio, an ideal and a period of time. 
Lots of great info on some classic rock records, lots of great interviews, beautifully edited. 
The gathering of legends at the end for one last hurrah with the Neve console is touching. 
The only misstep here is including Trent Reznor. Despite Grohl's repeated insistence that Reznor is using technology as an instrument, he seems to be going against everything Grohl is trying to keep alive. That organic element in music. Fighting against the computerized one. The same one that is prominent in everything Reznor does. Don't get me wrong, Reznor's a genius, but he shouldn't have been in this. 
Other than that though, this is a great. One of the best doc's of the year.",Sound City
4,Excellent documentary,Sound City
5,"Really eye opening to see how some of the best music artists made music in their time.

4,"Dave Grohl's breakout directing role, Sound City, shows Grohl's innate ability to direct a fantastic 'rockumentary': Packed full of great music, soft, artful lighting, genuinely engaged interviewees, and an extensive history of one of the significant recording studios of all time, it's no wonder why this film was loved by critics...and not so popular with the masses. If you aren't a huge music fanatic who would appreciate the significance of the Sound City Neve board or someone who enjoys a fantastically well-made documentary, you would honestly be bored to tears. Luckily though, I appreciate well-made documentaries and I enjoy learning about music. That being said, this documentary did not need to be nearly two hours long. Even during the last segment, Grohl performing with various artists that lead up to a big jam with Paul McCartney, I just wanted it to be over. I was sick of hearing about that board. I wanted a movie about a recording studio, not a recording devise.",Sound City

5,I absolutely LOVED this doc!,Sound City
4,"I've discovered the only thing that can make flying coach great: Sound City! 

This documentary resonates well beyond music which is why I liked it from second one. It's not about Nirvana or the Foo Fighters. It's about craft and significance: why we do what we do and how we do it. I came for the music and left with an analysis of the creative process from analogue to digital infused through songs. Suddenly I wondered why I wasn't a sound engineer. A great movie often makes you think outside of your own walls and Sound City excels at that. It's also Dave Grohl's first film, which is astonishing since it so artfully twines together multiple cinematographic devices from interviews, hand-held camera work, use of warming and cooling filters, reconstructions, multiple narrators, voice-over, thought bubbles, archival footage, etc. All of which could have resulted in a very confused production in less assured hands.

Little is known about Dave Grohl despite Nirvana and the Foo Fighters. In Sound City, we again see that he really knows how to surrounds himself with rare talents ""who have something to say"" to borrow Trent Reznor's words. Evidently, he has the charisma to drive everyone to supplement his original idea: telling the story of the Neve console. In the end though, Sound City documents the many lives of a historic recording studio and a feat of engineering, the Neve Console, through the music that came out of them from 1969 to 2011.

Nothing feels forced except perhaps the last 30 minutes when new recordings are made using the Neve console now housed in Dave's Studio 606. The making of Sound City Reel to Real, the film's vaunted soundtrack, could have done with a tighter edit. Trent Reznor explaining his use of technology as an instrument was much more captivating. In mere moments, he reached beyond the surgical precision of ProTools and sterility of Auto-Tune to give modern tools an honest assessment away from the good old days of analogue. 

What else is in it for us viewers? Musicians and non-musicians alike will find inspiration in the views exchanged on a studio that produced a crisp sound when its shag carpeted walls should have at best delivered a dirty sound. Sound City by all accounts was the studio equivalent of glorious flora growing from a smelly trash can in a way that no one can fully understand.

If you love music, technology and storytelling, this film will make for a terrific evening. As a bonus, you too may be reminded why Stevie Nicks sure wasn't going to be ""the cleaning lady"" for long in 'You Can't Fix This'.",Sound City
4,"Supremely interesting until you get to the end when its just 15 minutes of the remaining members of Nirvana jamming with Paul McCartney.  (which really had little to do with Sound City) The rest of the film though, great.  Truly an amazing rock and roll story.",Sound City
4,"Great 2/3 of a documentary, and i say that because while the first two thirds are about the history of the sound city music studio the last third is watching a studio session with various artists for an upcoming album. Not that the last third was not enjoyable but the movie definitely changes direction. There are a lot of music legends interviewed about a recording studio that has a great history.",Sound City
4,Classic doco on the board from sound city!!!,Sound City
3,Do yourself a favour - turn off X-Factor and rent this DVD about how real music is made - Thought the ending was a bit meh! But the story of Sound City (and parallels with Factory Records) is fascinating,Sound City
4,Awesome and educational.,Sound City
4,"I'm not sure exactly what Dave Grohl can't do.  This is a fantastic documentary about a place where many of the greatest or most successful albums of Rock were recorded. 

Grohl covers the history of the albums over the first half of the doc, and then switches gears by focusing on the recording console, which he purchased and moved to his own studio.  Next, he invites some of the biggest starts of Rock history to record an album, a kind of tribute to Sound City and the Neve soundboard.

First it was Nirvana, then Foo Fighters and now Film.  Everything the guy tries, he succeeds with.  This is a great movie to watch if you're a lover of rock music.",Sound City

Masterfully done and beautifully simple, just like his music.",Sound City

5,"Wow, what a phenomenal narrative. This look back into the inner workings of sound city and the great stories that come forth was so much fun to watch. If you are any type of music fan you cannot help but enjoy this wonderful story. Dave Grohl has knocked it out of the park with this one and has clearly demonstrated he is a man of many talents.

3,"An intimate look at one of the most storied recording studios ever in Los Angeles, CA, a place of magic and luck that appeared to be nothing more than a dump, but instead possessed an indescribable environment full of special people that ultimately stood the test of time despite many instances where it could have been sold. Director Dave Grohl, one of the best musicians of our time, shows a lot of skills behind the camera, making this little studio seem ultimately timeless despite the inescapable shifts in success it experienced given the changes in the music industry. Mostly, this documentary is a treat to watch because of the cameos involved, from Tom Petty, to Rick Springfield, to even Sir Paul McCartney, all with fond memories of when they produced albums there.",Sound City
5,"un documental que en mi opinion las nuevas generaciones deberian de ver,para asi saber lo que de verdad es buena musica,sonido de calidad e inigualable,por Sound City desfilaron las mejores bandas en la historia del Rock,desde Fleetwood Mac hasta Nirvana ...al final no me importa que me digan que soy viejo y me gusta musica antigua,porque eso para m√É¬≠...es el mejor de los halagos.",Sound City

3,"A treat to see iconic musicians performing & reminiscing so candidly; I'd recommend this documentary to anyone interested in 70s-90s rock & music making. Loads of fun to watch. But at the same time the film is an obviously unintentional example of the very impersonal, market-driven culture director/producer/star Dave  Grohl tries to resist. He celebrates authenticity  while making a promotional vehicle for himself, the film and of course the companion album. At the end of the film, you realize you've got great cocktail party conversation and little real understanding, and have a vague sense of unease about what the film might have been, and what it actually is..",Sound City
3,Great doc but switches focus at one point and continues on for another forty minutes or so.,Sound City
4,"Really well made rockumentary by Director/Musician Dave Grohl. He not only tells the story of Sound City, it's people and equipment, but he gathers so many great musicians and tells a bit of their stories too. Plus a history of studio recording from the 70's until now, with the transition from analog to digital and back around to analog again. The film really came to life for me in the middle when Nirvana breathed life back into Sound City. And the final act where Grohl creates his own new studio centered around the Neve console from Sound City, with collaborations among so many great artists like Reznor, Nicks, McCartney, Petty and others, just inspires the hell out of me. Fantastic cinematography, incredible sound and film editing, and just an all around stellar package.",Sound City
4,"A fantastic, musical journey through the history of Sound City Studios and the future of analog recording. Dave Grohl clearly has a passion for this project, and that excitement carries over on screen. Not surprisingly, the music is a perfect match for the film, but what is surprising is how visually adept Grohl is as a filmmaker. Sound City is both engaging and visually enthralling.

I am not a huge music person, so I think that is a difference in someone thinking this film is a brilliant documentary and a great film.  If you are into music and music history you will think this is probably one of the best documentaries ever made, if not you will still enjoy it!",Sound City
5,"Dave Grohl directed one hell of a documentary that's not only interesting, but makes you really think about what real music is.

4,Enjoyed and learned a lot from this documentary. Thumbs up to Dave Grohl.,Sound City
5,"Dave Grohl has always been one for doing whatever the hell he wants. Thankfully for us, what he wants is exactly what we view as an amazing fun time.
In a world where music is overproduced and every two-bit hack job can call themselves a producer, Sound City takes us back to a time where the only requirement for the music industry was talent. Raw  and unadulterated talent.
There is always a romantic aspect about doing things the old way, and Sound City reminds us that even in a world that moves faster than light, sometimes, sitting back in a home studio and just jamming with your friends can be one of the greatest joys a human will ever know.
10/10",Sound City

5,Fascinating look into the rise and fall of Sound City music studio.,Sound City
4,"""Sound City"" is a nostalgic documentary about what music sounded like before it was overproduced with ProTools and autotunes, which Dave Grohl and others of his ilk feel was better.",Sound City
3,A great story told by an impressive cast of musicians and producers. A little indulgent - especially in the second half - and it's anti-digital message comes off a bit old and curmudgeon-y.,Sound City
4,"Absolutely brilliant up to a point, the point being about 2/3rds of the way through when it turned from being a terrific documentary about Sound City into being an infomercial about Dave Grohl's new studio incorporating the Neve board from Sound City. One of the key factors in Sound City's success was the magical sound that drums had in its main studio; that obviously couldn't be moved to Grohl's new studio, so it's not clear why Grohl didn't just buy the old Sound City studio.",Sound City
3,The first hour is amazing.  Worth it just for that. The second part isn't so interesting.,Sound City
5,"One of the greatest tributes to music, the minds who create it and the studio that made it all possible. Dave Grohl's in depth look at the technological movement from analog to digital is done without bias... and the soundtrack is a mix of nostalgic classics and modern rock. This is the perfect rockumentary about a brand of music that may never replicated again. Reviewed 4/26/14. Rated 5 out of 5.",Sound City

4,"This documentary serves as a love story to arguably the greatest recording studio & its famous mixing board, told by some of the most talented artists of all time.",Sound City
4,"I was always kind of hesitant toward documentaries but this one really was great. Dave Grohl documents the evolution of a place called Sound City, a legendary recording studio.Through the evolution of Sound City, the transition to digital recording is also a focus. Throughout the film you hear stories about Sound City from big-time musicians. Grohl does such a good job with this, basically documenting a story that involves a clear protagonist and antagonist. The protagonist being Sound City and the antagonist being the shift to digital recording.",Sound City
4,"Dave Grohl's directional debut is a love letter to Sound City, the bare-bones, analogue recording studio in Van Nuys, California where he, a long with the rest of Nirvana, recorded Nevermind back in June of 1991. The documentary charts the rise of the studio through the 70's (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Fleetwood Mac) up to the modern day. What the film does best is romanticise about Sound  City's steadfast refusal to move into the digital era of the 90's with the likes of Pro Tools technology instead insisting on recording the same way they always had which unfortunately, led to the studio's closure in May 2011. Thanks to this heartwarming and loving documentary though it will thankfully never be forgotten. And of course we get to hear some great (old and new) music a long the way.",Sound City

4,A unique insight into a sound recording studio that had graced some amazing artists and produced some of the most incredible albums of the 70's onwards.

4,"LOVED THIS!  'Tis the story of the greatest soundboard in rock music.  Many of the greats booked time in that studio over 40 years, so naturally the music in the movie is phenomenal.  Dave Grohl directs, does the interviews, and tells his own story too.  They spend some time trying to figure out why it made everything sound so good, but ultimately it came down to playing live, playing real, and spitting in the face of that digital manipulation crap.  A new album of music was recorded after Grohl bought the console himself, bringing together many of the artists who made music at Sound City in the past.  And I'll be getting that album soon.",Sound City

5,I watched this twice on the plane coming home from China.  Dave Grohl is a creative genius.  The last part of the movie where he works/records with some of the original artists who recorded their hits at Sound City is amazing.,Sound City
4,"This is rocker Dave Grohl's love letter to rock music and the studio that gave his group Nirvana and many other well-known artists their start. For rock fans, the list of musicians that are interviewed will make them feel in rock heaven. All of them have great stories and Grohl matches it with great pictures and video. The beauty of this documentary is that you don't have to be a fan of rock music to appreciate the story. I was fascinated by the history of this little studio that could and even more impressed how many great albums it produced with very little resources. It wasn't about style, but substance. The entire first hour is a gem to watch. Then Grohl uses the remaining time to show a behind the scenes of the making of his new album. This adition makes it feel like we're watching two different movies. This is where the non-rock fans will lose interest. But, the music is fine to listen to and we do get to see Paul McCartney jam with Grohl. Overall, this is a very well made documentary that gives us insight of how music was and should be made.

Grade: A-",Sound City
5,Must see for music fans.,Sound City
4,"Some people really have the stars aligned on their favor and Dave Grohl is the leader of that clan. The dude is not only in magnificent bands, he's funny, apparently a good guy and he can also make pretty damned good documentaries. That is a charmed life if there is one. He deserves Courtney Love just for universal balance.

Sound City is a wonderful documentary, particularly if you love rock n roll. Originally slated to be the story of a console and a studio in LA that produced some epic albums (albeit being as close to a toilet as one can imagine), it goes in a different direction. 

Sound City is more about the humanity of rock n roll, the imperfections of the music and the ideals that make musicians want to play music. This film is not about a piece of equipment but rather about how a studio brought the most talented rockers alive with producers and some pretty cool people. The output of this chemistry is some of the most badass and timeless music you will ever hear.

I love rocknroll. More than i can describe in words. Which is ironic since I don't particularly love people and this movie eloquently describes how they come together. Maybe I'm missing out. 

Either way, this is a superb documentary with the obligatory  Grohl laughing face that should make you laugh too. If you don't fuck you.",Sound City

2,"The movie has no focus; is it about the studio, analogue vs. digital, friendship, or Dave Grohl making an absolutely self indulgent and boring record on an old Neve that many other bands happend to make great records on.  The movie spends so little time on each subject, the viewer has no time to care about any one of the little points the movie miserably fails at its attempt to make.  Or the viewer is buried in the minutia either boring interpersonal relationships of people the viewer hasn't been given a reason to care about, or boring interviews of boring people talking about the same boring ideas that music purists have been peddling for the last 30 years, building up to the predictable sob story turn; Pro Tools killed Sob City.  An utterly boring movie.",Sound City
5,"Loved it, surprisingly awesome!",Sound City
4,"A interesting fresh New Documentary directed by Foo Fighters front man Dave Grohl & he surprisingly crafted a fantastic film.

Basically the history of the infamous underground/dingy Recording Studio in an abandoned warehouse in the San Fernando Valley.

Dave Grohl details & interviews all the people who went & where involved in this incredible mostly unknown place, such an interesting place it seemed.

The latter part of the Documentary focuses on the Album Dave creates with famous musicians using the equipment used at Sound City...an insightful & terrific film.",Sound City
4,"An entertaining and engrossing inside look at a place that on the surface didn't look like much but deep down was one of the most important places in rock'n'roll history. I was glued the whole entire time, highly recommended for music lovers.

4,"For his directorial debut Dave Grohl has picked a fascinating subject; Sound City studio and the records recorded there.

It's clear that Grohl has a love for the subject and this shines through, but he doesn't force himself into the story, even though Nirvana played a big part in it.

The story of the studio, the bands, the records, the people, and the world of digital music are all equally represented in the film.  However, the biggest delight is the latter part of the film where Grohl rounds up a collection of the musicians who loved the studio to record a new album as the Sound City Players.

The sheer pleasure each of them have just jamming together and making a great rock record.

5,"Dave Grohl proves to be a very talented story teller as he weaves the fascinating tale of Sound City studios and It's 1990's resurrection after he recorded the highly influential album 'Never-mind' there in his Legendary but short lived stint as drummer in grunge phenomenon 'Nirvana'.  As the film comes to a close, It has some very powerful arguments against modern music (digital recording, pro tools) It probably has the most compelling arguments that anyone has ever made against modern music. 'Sound City' comes close and possibly succeeds at re invigorating a rapidly stagnating industry.",Sound City
4,"By far and away one of the best documentaries I have seen this year, Grohl puts real heart into a doc that at first appears to be about the now defunct Sound City recording studio, which gave birth to some of the biggest albums ever, but is in fact a loving tribute to the all but dead art of recording analogue over digital. As Grohl puts it many times over the course of the film, if it weren't for the studio or the Neve mixing desk 'he wouldn't be here now or have the career he has had'. A loving tribute to a by gone age featuring some of the biggest names in music, regardless of genre.",Sound City

4,Wonderful. A really interesting glimpse into the music culture.,Sound City
5,"Excellent. Don't miss this essential doc if you are into music, as I am. It was both very powerful and very sad, in its way... a final, piercing scream into the void of digital music and a celebration of the blood sweat and tears of real musicians making music that will outlast most of the crap being played on the radio today. It is especially poignant when giving us a few unguarded  moments with figures like Trent Reznor, Stevie Nicks, and others. Who would ever think the fire-breathing lead singer of NIN would just want to thank his mom for insisting he take piano lessons? This is more than just another doc; it's musical history.",Sound City
5,"Dave Grohl's directorial debut is a phenomenal documentary about the legendary Sound City Studios, a studio where some of the most legendary records in music history have recorded. Grohl interviews many musicians who have used the studio and they give their insight as to why Sound City was such an integral part in their creative process to create something memorable on tape. Sound City Studios was a studio that used analog recording equipment instead of digital to record its artists.  No matter the genre of music you enjoy, this is a must see documentary that is truly impressive. The stories told by the musicians are wonderful. Grohl goes deep into the subject matter and give his film the human connection of making music with a band, and not simply a computer. Analog tape is an obsolete technology in terms of recording, and the film gives us an explanation as to why recording with tape is the best way to record music. Grohl gets his point across very well by stating that with tape, you can hear every little mistake and imperfection, which makes the music more real, while with digital you can easily fix it, tweak and perfect it, but at the same time cheapening the feel of the art form. With that being said, I have a profound respect for this dying form of recording and the stories are simply stunning. Dave Grohl interviews everyone from Mick Fleetwood to Stevie Nicks, Neil Young, and Lars Ulrich to producers Rick Rubin, Butch Vig and Ross Robinson. I've seen plenty of music documentaries, all of them were great, but Sound City is very different. This is a film not just about a studio, but the human element of creating real, pure music from the heart, something that most popular artists of today have forgotten all about. Everything nowadays is all about auto tuned vocals, electronic, computerized beats and not about playing an actual instrument. Sound City is a film that will delight music fans as well as those interested in this classic recording method.",Sound City

5,"Fantastic documentary directed by a fantastic man, Dave Grohl.",Sound City
5,"Fantastic, a great documentary about the legendary recording studio Sound City. Dave Grohl did a phenomenal job directing this. He got a ton of great musicians to help tell the story of this studio. It was really interesting learning on how this studio got a lot of bands to start and how their albums really helped the studio stay in business. There was never a dull moment, it keeps you interested and everyone that has something to say is great. The people all have a great sense of humor and stories to tell on how they went about choosing Sound City and what happened once digital recording took over. It was cool to see the final half hour include Dave recording most of the songs in his studio with these legendary musicians. He even bought the recording table that made the studio famous. I'm a huge music fan and for anyone that loves music and recording definitely check this out. You'll learn so much, have a great time watching it and hear so much great music. It was really good, one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time.",Sound City

4,"A must-watch for any rock fan, and more importantly Sound City is watchable even for those who don't care for documentaries.

Who does Dave Grohl think he is making a  great roc doc having no experience as a director? Regardless, this man can do it all and apparently with ease. Grohl's attention to detail and story is vivid. I myself am not much into documentaries but I knew being a rock fan I had to see this one and I was honestly surprised at how good it was. 

Only Dave Grohl could get the likes of Tom Petty, Trent Reznor, Stevie Nicks and of course Neil Young to tell the story of the great Sound City. I did not know too much about Sound City coming into this movie and I was pleased to learn more. Grohl told a great quickly-paced story of the classic recording venue spanning from the 70's all the way until the digital generation of now killed it.

Grohl lets the viewer deep inside the recording studio with Sound City, which is to rock as the recent doc ""Side by Side"" was to the film industry. Both films focus on how digital is changing our lives and in some ways for the worse as quantity is taking over for quality.

One cool aspect to Sound City was how we're treated to a present day recording session of Sound City's board in Grohl's house as he wanted to save a piece of Sound City as they went out of business. It was a nice change of pace and it was cool to see some of these old artists record on the historical board one last time. It did suck however that Grohl couldn't get Tom Petty or Neil Young to record with him.

If Grohl is this good in his directorial debut, I hope he continues telling rock stories because he has a true talent  for rock story-telling.",Sound City

It becomes a deeply moving film, touching on issues of abuse and domestic violence, what it means to be a man from the urban working classes and how we deal with our past and the impact it has on our present and future. It's remarkably clear-eyed for a film made by someone about himself and his group of friends, and it manages to keep weaving the narrative of the boys' lives around their love of skateboarding without ever becoming a film just about the sport itself. Revealing and powerful without ever being miserable, it deserves to be seen by the widest of audiences.",Minding the Gap

A genuine exploration of life, luck (or lack thereof), friendship, abuse, hope, loss, circumstance, family, parenting, and the devastating effects of inaction and a prolonged lack of direction or responsibility. Every single main character in this movie has had fatherhood profoundly impact their life. I turned this on thinking it was just a skateboarding doc and in one of the last scenes I cried...hard with one of the main characters. Just a fucking incredible movie that forces you to examine whether you deserve the credit you give yourself for your own life and ask yourself whether you'd be anywhere near where you are had you been born into one of the situations shared in this unbelievably intimate film.

We follow them for 4-5 years I guess, some as young as 18 when the first footage is done. Keire comes a long way, Bing - the director, too. Zack has ups and downs.

Many interesting interviews with parents, other family and friends and some cool skate action. They all find therapy riding their boards. They say it best themselves: ""skating is more of a family for me than my real family"" or ""yes, skateboarding hurts me, but I love it so much. Just like my dad. He hit me, but I still love him to death"".

Strong scenes, and a film with deep emotional core. The directorial debut from Bing and I kind of hope this will be his only piece. It's such a great self biography and the amatourish plus look is making it even better.

Loads of deserved nominations and wins, even an Oscar. A huge victory for the boys, a huge victory for the skateboard community.

4,"OLLIE OLLIE IN COME FREE

Boys to men skating for their lives, Bing, Zack and Keire glide to gloomy adulthood across lower class America in a jarringly potent documentary. Starting innocently with frivolous summery teen joviality, ""Minding The Gap"" seamlessly moves into bleak futures that ride on dark histories.

The charismatic trouble leader, Zack smokes, skates and drinks his days away, stubbornly fighting adulthood and responsibility. And as much as he dominates the screen, happy go lucky goof Keire steals the movie with his emphatic optimism. As the filmmaker, Bing spends most of the time in the shadows, but steps out to confront his horrific past. Something all three share. 

""Minding The Gap"" is a great, free-wheeling snapshot of exuberant youth, a harsh look at family strife, a brutal glance into the sinking have nots, a brilliant take on race, and one helluva film.

It is the present version of the all-American dream: scarred, messy, shattered, but with hope. Not to be missed.

3,"Apart from a forced attempt at sentimentality in the end and the fact that the editing feels mostly random with not much sense of structure, I appreciate how close to Liu's heart his film is and how it shows that skateboarding can be a means for some people to get away from domestic abuse.",Minding the Gap
5,"Powerful, beautiful, and incredibly edited film.  Poignant in many ways, deserving of an Oscar.",Minding the Gap
5,"I was absolutely surprised by this movie. Minding the Gap is a documentary about three friends and how their lives and skateboarding change them into the people they are today. The film was shot over a 12 year period starting when they kids are very young to them becoming young adults. We follow Zack who is having a baby, but he himself is a very troubled young man resorting to abuse and alcohol. We have Kiere who regrets much of his past and his relationship with his father, but is trying to better himself. Then we have Bing (who also is the director) who had a very abusive step dad and sees a lot of himself in his friends stories. All three stories are interwoven and you eventually get to see how these guys mature. The movie is definitely a coming of age documentary and it just works. It's beautifully shot and features people that by the end of the movie you actually really care about what happens. It has some really good pacing and it was a movie that I just had to finish to see how it ended. Overall, a gem of a film that I highly recommend.",Minding the Gap

5,"Minding the Gap is a truly extraordinary film about ordinary people. It's illuminating, hugely emotional, instructional and thought provoking. It starts as a skateboarding film but delves deep into the heart of America in such a way that it will affect you in a multitude of ways. Set in the economically depressed small American city of Rockford, Illinois the film is essentially set over 4 or so years in the lives of young and troubled men. Director Bing Liu is one of those men. He is film maker and also film subject. His friends are a tightly knit young group that bond over skating. As the film opens we watch them gracefully and expertly skate through the streets of Rockford. Three men in particular are the focus. Bing, born in China but raised in the US. Zack, slightly older and kind of wild and reckless. Keire, African American and raised by his single mother. In the beginning we enjoy their friendship and their skating prowess but as the film ensues we get to know them much more. We see their quite desperation, their want for a better life, their struggles with manhood. Then ultimately their shared stories of domestic violence. At this point the film really digs deep. It's quite an emotional roller coaster. It's extremely candid but also beautifully handled. We see their foibles hand in hand with their struggles. It's deeply personal but also manages to shine a light on the troubles in growing up and the challenges faced. I dare anyone not to be moved by this superb film.",Minding the Gap
3,"Wow...an interesting approach. I understood the message, I think? Oscar nominee???",Minding the Gap
4,"Excellent portrayal of growing up into manhood in a dying Midwestern city without much parental care or guidance, yet learning how to survive and at times thrive through a shared love of skateboarding. This is a deeply affecting film that celebrates the human experience without glossing over the pain and heartache most everyone goes through while finding oneself.",Minding the Gap
5,"A documentary about the real life challenges of growing up under-privileged in an economically declining suburb masquerading as documentary about rebellious teens living free in their obsession of skateboarding. 

Doesn√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)t sound interesting to me at all. I avoided this movie because I assumed it was just another flick about skateboarding. Nothing against skateboarding, but it√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)s just not my cup of tea. Once I saw that it was nominated for an Oscar, I decided I√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)d give it a shot. After all, some of my favorite docs are the ones that seem like they√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)d be the least interesting to me (like the one I LOVE that√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)s all about salt). √Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)

I started off thinking this would be a typical √Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2extreme sport√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2√Ø¬ø 1/2√Ç? film √Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2"" a niche doc that will give some insight into boarders and their lifestyle. I figured it was probably nominated for all these awards because of the cinematography or something similar. And sure enough, it started off just like that. 

But little by little, the documentarian (who happens to be just one of the kids in this group of skaters), starts to weave the backstories of his friends into the footage. And before you know it, you√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)re hooked. You√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)re invested in these kids as they navigate their future. 

To me, what makes a great documentary is its ability to open your eyes and mind to something new. I learned nothing about skateboarding but I learned a lot about the life of kids growing up in a different world right here in the United States. I changed my opinions about some of these people in an instant. I gained insight into some of my own privileged bias. And then, to top it off, I remembered this started off as just a teen filming his friends skateboarding.",Minding the Gap

Minding The Gap

Liu's documentary on a diverse group of people that are connected with one heart pumping passion is not only an essential eye opening subject to explore upon but is also a gripping and compelling family drama. As far as the clips of all the skateboard stunts are concerned, there is no need to look back. But one of the main reason why they work so smoothly on narration, is when the makers need a visual medium while someone is narrating, these clips help immensely for them to link all the parallel tracks perfectly. Divided into three tracks and three lives, the one that connects you with majorly is Johnson's or at least it did to me.

Since his track does not stand exceptionally alone, one can connect on multiple level with his life. On the other hand, the truly dramatic or cinematic of all, is of Liu's which is so sharp and powerfully executed that the emotions may rumble you down to tears. And the rest of the space is taken by Johnson who has his own dodgy issues where the other related to him too gets to factor in effectively, a fair and balanced trial put on by the maker.

Another primary reason it speaks more to the common people, is because they keep them grounded as much as possible, despite of having an exceptional life, the tiny details on their routines and light and breezy equation with someone, is how they easily get under your skin. Liu; the director, himself has done a splendid work on foliating the drama that they went through, it can be really difficult to project your own story with such conviction especially without any manipulation or milking too much of the material. Minding The Gap is the most balanced documentary possible, it sticks by its job, the genre never overtakes the content and the drama communicates with you.",Minding the Gap

4,"I feel as if this compilation of subjects' lives gives many great themes and voices, and It does it very well. I especially appreciate how time and effort is put into introducing subjects visually, because even in documentaries, exposition bores.

5,One of the most pleasant surprises of 2018 I discovered with boxxy software app. What starts out seemingly like a skate-culture doc turns into a heart-felt and powerful meditation on abuse among families. All three main characters are extremely sympathetic. The way it all comes together - the way it invites you into the thesis - and how the filmmaker explains to his subjects what the doc is truly about - is masterful.,Minding the Gap
3,"a great documentary of about three boys and how their childhoods turned made them turn to skating for escapism.

Everyone has their own life struggles, some harder than others. This documentary by Bing Liu clearly showcases that. I think he did a great job, he just followed these people from his life over a time period and saw how they evolved. We all have our own life journey and choices to make, whether it's good or bad, we make them.

5,"I came across this gem at the Telluride Mountain Film at the suggestion from Barry Jenkins.  Simply put, this was one of the best documentaries in years and deserves the Oscar for best documentary this year.  What may seem like a boyhood skateboarding movie is so much more about the state of America and the ones who are often left behind, struggling to live a better life as each character face the reality of adulthood, history of abuse, and a town that's struggling for a better life.  It weaves the story of three young men, and a young woman as they try for a better life in midwest USA.  Each heart break, each secret, each bad decision, and ultimately each hope are told beautifully from an autobiographical lense of Bing Liu, a brilliant young film maker who shares something so personal that you may feel like an intruder or a therapist who's uncovering layers of mystery and history.  In the process, one can hope that there's a process of healing in telling the story and that each of the characters are learning to forgive, love, and ultimately become better version of themselves.  This is a stunning documentary that won both the Juror and Audience Awards at Telluride Mountainfilm.  Sometimes a little movie comes along and reminds us the power of story telling and it's ability to move your soul, mind, and heart.  This movie is bound to linger in your mind for days after watching.  It's a stunning debut that deserves an Oscar for best documentary.",Minding the Gap

And it is a social commentary on how first world nations are dealing with the refugee crisis and the struggles of refugees in a foreign bureaucratic system that is more designed to weed out applicants than it is to help them. The acting is excellent. The viewer feels their pain, indeed. Even good people have done horrible things and guilt will always catch up to good people who are capable of feeling guilt. There's plenty of blood, mostly in a ritualistic sense, there's drama and angst and moments of watching a good man destroy himself.

The film, which tells the psychological tension of a refugee couple who are trying to exist in Western countries with their ethnic origins, and the psychological tension they experience after trauma, does not leave the feeling of fear while doing this. It is a genius idea of the director that he tells the struggle of black people to exist and the difficulties they experience with the factor of fear. An endless mystery in the movie and when the events begin to unravel, it imprisons the audience with its twist scenes. At the same time, thanks to the director who gives the horror effect very well in terms of atmosphere, sound and technique, you are always uneasy at the place you sit while watching the movie.",His House

5,"This is more than a thriller/typical horror movie. It is an allegory of how guilt and sadness and loss can torment a human soul.  When the main characters come to terms with the ghosts of the past and their actions, they can find peace and hope for the future.  The refurbishing of the house at the end is another allegory of the foundation they can lay now for their new life. Wonderful movie.",His House
4,"The true horror in this haunted house tale comes from the trauma of the refugees,  As the nature of the ""debt"" unfolds the characters give an excellent contrast in the toll the trauma exacts.  If you enjoyed the allegory of Babadook, you will find this just as rewarding.",His House

5,Stunning visuals and powerful metaphor for PTSD. Must see.,His House
3,"This is an odd movie. The acting is very strong, and so is the story. His House is about a young refugee couple coming from war-torn Sudan to England. It is about coping with the loss of their daughter, who drowned during their crossing to Europe, and about coping with the loss of everyone they knew in their village -who were killed in a brutal massacre. It is about mourning and coming to terms with loss. Also about getting settled into a new place that is completely foreign to you and not always very welcoming. 
But then, there's also jump-scares. They are caused by their unresolved trauma, but for me this classical horror-element didn't fit into the movie. I love a good horror movie and a strong drama movie, but the combination of the two doesn't really work for me here. Despite this, it is still a strong movie and I would recommend watching it.",His House
5,Amazing story line. This movie is definitely one that everyone should see. The sad part of this movie are the many untold stories of Refugees.,His House
1,"The movie had plenty of jump scares, which was great, but the plot was terrible. It was random and not properly developed. The background story line with the housing people just made everything confusing, and took away from the true horror aspect of the movie. Typically looking bad guy with wrinkly skin and light colored eyes, saying ""you're mine."" And the ending just seemed like the directors ran out of time and said ""aah, screw it. Just let it die,"" like it wasn't a mystical creature and could be killed like a human. Ultimately a fail in my book. The best part of the movie was the twist, and that's the only reason I gave it 1.5 stars.",His House

3,"Well, I think that after all they had been through in that house, they shouldn't have hung around there. It was psychological warfare with that house. The guy was going insane in there, and his wife was being affected by the house too. It's not so much of the house being haunted, it's more of he was feeling bad about kidnapping a child to get away from whatever was happening there in Africa and get on that bus. The mother was upset because they took her kid from her. The child was killed. It was so tragic. But they shouldn't have continued to hang around there. Everything that happened to them haunted them when they started living in that house.",His House
5,"Not only is this a perfectly executed horror film. It's also a deep dive into trauma, survivor's guilt, and assimilation.",His House
4,"Guilt makes the world turn. In His House, Bol (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are refugees fleeing the carnage of civil war in South Sudan. They've successfully arrived in the U.K. and are one of the select few who are granted asylum (on a probationary period), which includes a small stipend and an apartment. Through flashbacks and visions, the characters relive the horror in their old country. Racked with grief over losing their daughter during the perilous journey, and survivor's guilt for actually making it, the couple separate in belief for what their futures will hold: Bol wants to assimilate entirely into British culture ‚Äî he pushes English as their language, forks and knives for dining, and even learns soccer chants ‚Äî while Rial has resolved that they will be returned to South Sudan and seems to long for the country, even though many of her friends and family were massacred. Rial does have a poor experience when she does finally leave the house: a trio of teens mock her accent, tease her with the directions she asked for, make offensive ululations, and tell her to go back to Africa because Britain is for the British. However, if you pictured racist skinheads saying these things, you'd be understandably wrong ‚Äî they were three Black British boys. Did I mention that this is a horror movie though? That's right, an apeth or a ""night witch,"" (Javier Botet and Cornel John) has become the couple's roommate and incessantly haunts them. The scares are pretty good, especially when Weekes makes use of the holes in the wall, but there's nothing here that's going to keep you up at night. The scene with the apeth‚Ä¶ I guess‚Ä¶ ""entering"" Bol suffered from not the best CGI, but it was still creepy. The final shot serves its purpose and might be the most haunting of the movie. This is an original, genre-bending plot, and I definitely recommend His House. *Side Note* I purposefully misstated a plot point because the movie is relatively new and not the most well-known and to accurately recount it would've been a spoiler.",His House
3,"It was as decent. A slow burn-I might have stopped watching but there was a mystery that I could not solve to my own satisfaction without the reveal towards the end.

It also delves into the true horrors of the refugee crisis with some sociopolitical commentary and at the same time it delivers some genuine and effective jump scares and weird supernatural occurrences. A very unusual horror tale that is also the great debut of first-time director Remi Weekes and shows great talent. The third act however could have been better.",His House

4,"As Sudanese refugees Bol (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) attempt to settle into their new home in Britain, His House nails the feelings of being an immigrant, of feeling out of place and unwanted, totally alienated to your surroundings down to a frightening and informative tee. Remi Weekes' film conveys its characters' very real world plight with excellent abstract horror, his combination of spooky visuals and uncomfortable environmental aggressions becoming something greater than simple narrative allegory. His House IS the pangs for home, the guilt of escape, and the doubt of displaced normalcy, its horror DNA as much a dissection of universal immigrant emotion as it is a uniquely South Sudanese psychological nightmare.",His House

4,"His House is a fresh debut from writer-director Remi Weekes, artfully translating the refugee experience and survivor's guilt into a harrowing and scary horror story led by a pair of heroic performances.",His House
1,"The true litmus test of a horror film is whether or not it's scary, and this one fails miserably on that front. In addition to its lack of good scares, this debut feature from director Remi Weekes is often more muddle than riddle, taking seemingly forever to establish the nature of the story and then taking even longer to explain the reasoning behind it. And, through it all, the film is loaded with an array of allegedly frightening (and often-disconnected) moments that shed little light on what's transpiring but that have apparently been left in primarily for their visual impact (which isn't all that great, either). Admittedly, the picture manages to garner some worthwhile attention as it nears its conclusion, but, by that point, it's unlikely viewers are going to care much. Also, the film attempts to work in some allegorical sociopolitical commentary, which, if handled better, might have made this a much better picture. Unfortunately, there's not enough of what the film does well and far too little of what it needs to do better, leaving audiences with a plodding, dull, disappointing effort unworthy of the three BAFTA Award nominations it received (and that truly should have gone to more deserving offerings).",His House

Different strokes for different folks.  I,m in no way trashing the movie.  The actors are fab and there were some genuinely well crafted scenes but in no way would I ever give this a full or higher score.",His House
3,Extraordinary and unusual haunted house drama skillfully combines genre tropes with the refugee experience as strangers in a not so welcoming land.,His House
3,"HIS HOUSE is certainly a horror story, with weird, supernatural goings-on and more than one or two effective jump scares.  Taken as just a horror story, though, it is fairly ordinary.  The setting is unusual, but ""a couple moves into a new dwelling only to find ‚Äòsomething' is already there and isn't happy to share the space"" is hardly the stuff to get a horror fan excited.

HOWEVER, take a look at the broader picture.  A couple, who have fled civil war-torn Sudan via a harrowing journey that comes with a great loss, are now refugees in England, and have a tiny chance to win asylum.  In the meantime, they must live in a rundown slum apartment and behave themselves while the government gets it all sorted out.  This couple doesn't really have the option to move out when the weird things start happening.  They have a choice between tolerating their shabby and scary living conditions, or going back to Sudan to the daily fear of being gunned down in the street.  

This makes HIS HOUSE much more interesting.  The stakes seem much higher than in a typical ""family in danger"" horror film.  But, I would argue, what really makes it interesting is the reaction of the couple to the supernatural.  They come from a culture where witchcraft and other elements of the supernatural are part of life.  Maybe not part of daily life, but they are accepted and to some extent, believed.  So the couple quickly pivot to trying to figure out WHY they're being haunted, and not IF.  They accept it, and react to it from that perspective.

Yet, for me, the best parts of this movie were the flashbacks to Sudan and the journey to escape.  (I wanted to say ""journey to freedom"", but that isn't really what they encounter.)  We learn about them, and we learn a very key secret that could be the answer to their haunting.  I won't say more, except to say that this secret elevates the film from interesting setting but generic plot to something much more resonant.  And the ending, while perhaps abruptly presented, is a nearly perfect conclusion to their story.  Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku are the two stars, and they are excellent.  They are a couple made close by their shared experience, but their reactions to what happened on their journey and what's happening to their house show the divides between them, and make their ""happy"" marriage seem much more complex.  The film also excels in showing us just how alone they are in their new country.  When Mosaku gets lost in her neighborhood, she asks some black teenage boys for directions, thinking she might receive a friendly reception.  When they laugh at her, give her wrong directions and then derisively tell her to ""go back to Africa"", it's a shocking moment that has nothing to do with the supernatural.  These ""real"" moments are what elevates the film.

I wish the movie had taken a bit more time.  Because it's chiefly a horror film, I think director/write Remi Weekes (in a great debut) tried to keep things moving along briskly.  They do, but there are moments in this film crying out for more time.  The ""secret"" that is revealed is shown hastily (probably in part because budget limitations might have made giving us more detail challenging).  And the ending, as apt as it is, could have been presented in a way to linger more in our memories.

It's still a pretty amazing little film.  I likely won't go back to it, but I'm certainly glad I DID spend time with it.",His House
4,"Your ghosts follow you. They live with you. They never leave.  

Ok. This was actually pretty good, and scary, and exciting. This is how you reinvent the haunted house genre. It goes way beyond jump scares. It relies on grief, trauma, and letting go of the past. It does get scary and it has very creepy imagery that will stay with you after the credits roll, and even if it feels kind of slow at some point, in the end, it all adds to the story.",His House
3,"His House is the story of South Sudanese refuges trying to adjust to living in England in government housing with the creatures that live there and their own traumatic memories.  Strong performances and general creepiness work well.  It is great to see something ""new"" in the horror world.  I wish a little more info was provided on the ""big bad"" as culturally most viewers wont have a lot of perspectives on it which makes it tricky to judge the final act.  This film will likely work even for those who don't like most horror movies.",His House

3,"""Your ghost follows you. They never leave. They live with you. It's when I let them in, I could start to face myself.""

If I must be honest, I only checked this one out because of the BAFTA nomination, because this being nominated was so random for me, as I have never heard of it. I guess award season are not always pointless after all, since it introduces people to different movies that would be easily overlooked, especially for mainstream audiences.

But yeah, the movie focus on a refugee couple arriving to England to hopefully start a new life and forget their past. The house they are saying in is an absolute shit hole. Decayed, holes in the wall, and school kids urinating on the property because they thought the house was abandoned. Outside is no better. People either not helpful or just awful. However, if that wasn't worst, there's something sinister happening in the house. Behind the walls, behind every corner, there is something supernatural. The house itself is not haunted, it's them. When they left Africa, a dark spirit followed them. They have been marked by a Witch.

The movie has got fantastic cinematography that effectively uses lights and shadows in open spaces to make for one unnerving movie. Everything looks so bleak and hopeless. The performances from Wunmi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu were both terrific. It felt natural and haunting. Matt Smith also makes a small appearance in a couple of scenes and he was good as well. Then again, I have never seen Smith give a bad performance yet.

However, towards the end of the movie it did get a little too carried away with its ghost elements where I felt it could've gone down a more subtle psychological climax. And while I am aware of the small budget, but some of the visual effects looked phony and unnecessary condensing they could have been done in a more practical way, with make-up etc.

I went into this knowing nothing but came out surprised. An impressive project from director Remi Weekes.",His House
3,"It is a slow-burning movie, so one has to be patient to watch it, it is not a template based horror movie. In fact, it is more of a psychological thriller than horror. It explores human nature to a depth, using the life of refugees as the background.",His House

2,"I had to look this movie up to make sure I was remembering the same movie that all of these critics rated so highly. The tomatometer score for His House is a head scratcher! It's not a *bad* movie by any stretch... It's a pretty stereotypical haunted house movie (aside from the ghost not actually doing anything) throughout the film. There wasn't a single moment of dread or terror in this entire exercise in banality. Perhaps the reviewers who called it horrifying just don't watch that much horror?

I won't speculate on what motivated critics to call this film ""original"" or ""a breath of fresh air, but this is further evidence that we simply don't need them anymore.",His House

4,This was a welcomed addition to Netflix for sure.  Some very unsettling moments throughout the whole movie. Both of a more paranormal nature and that of a horrific world we live in at times.  Its overall subtle ( till near the end) and emotional.  You will be back and forth about whos side you are on. 100% worth a watch.,His House
5,"His House is a horrifying and thoughtful film with ample scares for the avid horror movie goer but has a deeper and emotional level that will give viewers pause to the struggles of immigration. The film is about a Sudanese couple that are seeking asylum in London, England and as it progresses we see inner demons at work and how they overcome them forms the crux of the story.
Being a horror movie buff, I really enjoyed the movie on this premise alone but I believe the movie is a much deeper metaphor about the difficulties that immigrants/refuges face when relocating to a new country. To the better life they were promised to leaving their old country and lives behind, one can rarely imagine how difficult this is without having done it themselves. The Promised Land often turns out quite different then the dreams and reality soon sinks in. Early on we see the couple, Bol and Rial finally being placed into their new home which is quite disturbing. The house is completely rundown and is complete with no electricity and some old furniture. Yet they are told that it is large and they are lucky to have it. Bol is eager to remain positive and start a new life as quickly as possible where as Rial sees the house for what it really is and believes that they deserve better. 
Early on we see that Bol and Rial are at odds with each other and Bol sees visions of their dead daughter; she had drowned on a part of the journey to England. 
The balance of assimilating to the new culture and keeping their own culture and beliefs alive is a fine line. We see an example of this when Bol decides to burn remnants of their own lives under the guise of the demon that is haunting them but Rial is quite opposed to this as she wants to cling to their culture. Bol believes that assimilating aggressively and forgetting their past is the best approach to a new life.
We see examples of discrimination that immigrants often face when Rial ventures out in the community for the first time and is ridiculed for her accent and cultural outfit by local black kids when she asks for help. It was quite sad to see black people make fun of their own just because they were born in London and she was not.
We see that Bol is haunted by a demonic presence that quickly erodes all his sanity and forces him to destroy the house quarrel with Rial. We soon learn the back story to Rial and Bol and the circumstances that forced them to leave Sudan. War and conflict engulfs their city and the viewers are subject to merciless massacre. Rial is a school teacher who avoids certain death by hiding in the classroom while her fellow students and teachers are murdered. She soon reunites with Bol and they come at a crossroads when the last bus is leaving the town while a crowd of people struggle to get on. Bol tries to negotiate their passage on the bus but when all else fails he kidnaps a young girl and claims her to be his daughter while the mother is seen crying as the men with guns start shooting. The truth sinks in, Nyagak was not their real daughter as they were forced to commit a terrible crime to escape certain demise.
Now we understand why there are at odds with each other. Rial is quite disturbed that Bol does not want to accept the truth of what he did and why it was wrong. When the demon that haunts Bol tries to kill him we see Rial step in and save her husband. She realizes that what he did was a matter of life and death Glimpses of their old friends are soon seen and the demon haunts them no more. They are content now to rebuilding their lives together in London. 
This movie hit hard for me because I'm a son of an immigrant that escaped her country and to seek asylum in Canada. She gave up her dreams to give her children a better life in this new country and works a minimum wage job at a local McDonalds. Growing up she instilled the importance of education and hard work as a key driver to financial freedom.  As I grew up, I achieved certain success and see myself quite simply as a local and not a son of a visible minority immigrant. It's easy to forget about your parent's struggles and sacrifices they made to raise you especially during the grind of your own daily life. In the past I've even talked down to her and made fun of her accent albeit in a teasing way. This film presented a deep glimpse into my own life and how I can improve it and pay my gratitude to my mom. I now often find myself being extra polite to the stranger serving me coffee at Tim Hortons or delivering me food on Uber. Their journeys to Canada may never well be told but I can only imagine that they fight their own inner demons every day and make sacrifices in promise of a better life for themselves and their children.",His House

3,"As if refugees don't have it hard enough.  So this is about a couple (Sope Dirisu, Wunmi Mosaku).  They travel seeking asylum in England after escaping war-torn South Sudan, and the only place the government has to offer them is some dilapidated housing.  If they can survive the squalor, they are going to have to figure out what to do with the supernatural witches who followed them to their new residence.  Now, like most of these movies that have been popping up on Netflix, I knew very little about this.  All I could tell was that it was a horror movie, and while I heard some general positive word of mouth, I missed out on any specifics.  While I think there are elements to appreciate here, I don't feel like they successfully sidestep many of the follies that modern horror faces these days.  So for positives, I do think that the actors do the best they can here, and for the most part, they are people that you haven't seen before.  Matt Smith of Dr. Who fame is the biggest name attached, and even then, he only has a small role in this.  You'll recognize Wunmi Mosaku if you watched Lovecraft Country earlier this year, but other than that, it was all new faces for me, which is usually a benefit in the horror genre.  Once you start to place actors from other movies you've seen, that's when the story typically gets less scary.  I don't count Javier Botet from [Rec] since he has made a career out of playing monsters, and it's not like you're going to recognize him anyway.  I do appreciate how they give a legitimate reason why it isn't practical to leave this rundown home, and that is something that is almost always a problem in the haunted house subgenre.  I also think that there are individual scenes in this that are effective because of the creativity, and if nothing else, this is a movie that will make you jump at several points throughout.  These are all positives, so what's the problem?  For me, this movie never becomes more than the sum of its parts.  It sets the stage early on to have commentary on social politics and racism, but then they never follow through on it.  Almost all of the best science fiction and horror typically have something to say, but this movie is more focused on things that go bump in the night.  His House is a movie that is all surface, and it is a bit disappointing because I can't help but feel like they could have done so much more with it.  These characters are not deep; they simply have demons from their past.  When you're dealing with a subject matter as taxing as survivor's guilt, I will always prefer an emotional through-line.  The scares are sometimes successful, but they're only doing tricks that you've seen before in other movies.  I wish this all came together with more cohesion.  As it stands, this is just quality ingredients with a faulty oven.",His House

It would be fair to say Remi Weekes' ""His House"" rides the coattails of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" in terms of wanting to be a social commentary that fronts as a horror movie. And to be clear, this isn't a bad thing. ""His House"" is just as engaging as ""Get Out,"" though for different reasons, and it makes us even more grateful for Peele's film and its commercial and critical success, because it obviously paved the way for other storytellers and studios to harness and reinvigorate genre pictures in order to convey messages that are important and topical. And because they're genre pictures, it's a safe bet we can rely on them to at least hold our attention and be entertaining. In this sense, movies like ""Get Out"" and ""His House"" deliver a complete package of thoughtfulness and escapism.

At the center of both films lies the theme that fear and anxiety can arise whenever we feel we're not wanted. More precisely, it's about how people of color are especially prone to experience such feelings. Whereas ""Get Out"" focused on racism as a core contributor to mental and physical agitation, ""His House"" cites xenophobia, specifically toward black refugees. 

Even though the metaphors and symbolism in Weekes' screenplay, from a story by Felicity Evans and Toby Venables, are obvious (and inevitably not as fresh or unexpected as those in Peele's film, which had the benefit of coming out first), they're still effective. Like ""Get Out,"" ""House"" calls attention to a serious social issue by utilizing traditional horror movie tropes, in particular the old ""on one condition"" device, whereby characters are told they can acquire an estate of some sort‚Ä¶""one on condition."" And yes, you guessed it, that condition is the estate is haunted.

To be fair, the ""estate"" in question isn't really an estate, meaning it's hardly large or luxurious, and it hasn't been bequeathed to the characters by a rich relative or anything like that. Plus, the place itself isn't inherently haunted‚Äîit's the characters who bring the evil with them. 

Even so, my heart initially sank thinking it would be this hackneyed setup ""House"" would use to fuel its story. However, to the film's credit, it reveals its deeper, more solemn agenda early on and we find ourselves less caught up in its conventions and cliches and more in its people and their situations.

Much of this owed to the film's dynamic and superb leads, Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku. They play Bol and Rial Majur, a young married couple who have recently escaped the violence and devastation of their native South Sudan. When the British government grants Bol and Rial probational asylum, Dirisu and Mosaku immediately prove just how expressive and convincing they are as actors, because upon their characters receiving word they'll be given their own house, we sense their overwhelming relief and hope. We see it in their eyes and hear it in their breath. Their feelings of elation contrast with those of the British officials, who view Bol and Rial as just another set of refugees to process instead of as human beings worth saving.

All this follows an ominous opening sequence during which Bol has a nightmare and recalls the painful loss of his and Rial's daughter, Nyagak (Malaika Wakoli-Abigaba), who drowned as their refugee boat crossed the Mediterranean. With the news they can now stay in Britain, Bol and Rial want to believe their daughter's tragedy is behind them and they can start anew, but there's something about their sudden good fortune that still doesn't feel quite right.

Not that their new house is all that good of a fortune anyway. It sits in the middle of a foggy, rundown area just outside London, and we wince when their less-than-sensitive case worker, Mark (Matt Smith), gives them a tour of their new ""home,"" which is laden with trash, infested with rats, barely held up by peeling walls, and emits a pungent odor. Mark's cavalier attitude toward the conditions supports the sad but probably true idea that government authorities often view refugees as beggars who don't have the right to be choosers and, for them, anything should be better than nothing. What's more is the neighborhood's other tenants immediately scowl at Bol and Rial, sending them looks of disdain and ""How dare you think you can come here?!"" Some even explicitly yell at them, ""Go back to Africa!""

Through all this, Weekes get us to legitimately ponder that even though Bol and Rial are under no immediate physical threat like the fires, bombs and guns posed in South Sudan, they're still subject to inhumane treatment, including mental stress, depression, loneliness and ostracization, which can be just as damaging to a person's well-being. Both feel the pressure to assimilate lest they be sent back, with Bol going so far as to buy polo shirts and join the locals at a pub to watch a football match. Rial is less submissive and feels she shouldn't have to relinquish her culture, and certainly not sentimental keepsakes such as her daughter's necklace.

If ""Get Out"" used comedy and horror to lighten its mood and temporarily release some of the racial tension it stirred, ""His House"" chooses drama and horror. The latter comes in the usual forms of strange, inexplicable visions and noises that Bol and Rial see and hear as they try to make a home out of their crumbling surroundings. They see the corpses of their fallen fellow refugees and other disturbing objects embedded into the walls. A grotesque, towering figure also sneaks up behind them but as soon as they turn around, there's nothing there.

Such typical horror devices might have come across as dull and standard if it weren't for the length to which Weekes' screenplay goes to explain them, which leads to the film's surprisingly effective and convincing drama. Without giving too much away, Rial tells Bol that she believes an apeth, or ""night witch,"" has followed them from South Sudan and is essentially punishing them for a past transgression. The witch presumably speaks to Rial but Bol would rather live in denial, although the mental and physical manifestations he endures as a result of the witch's presence begin to take their toll. His suffering is a reminder that just because we sometimes feel we've lived through extreme trauma and hardships doesn't mean we shouldn't be honest with ourselves and doesn't give us the right to treat others heartlessly. The film argues that we're all susceptible to selfishness, forgetting what really matters, and viewing people as objects rather than humans, and we need to learn to accept and deal with our pain.

This is a tried-and-true message, to be sure, but Weekes' and his cast relate it earnestly and effectually. The film builds itself up to an emotional payoff that is both dark and shattering but that gets us to really understand the characters' motivations. We end up seeing them as agonists rather than sinners and the film speaks genuinely about human desperation, especially when it comes to survival. And just because it's a horror movie doesn't mean we take its commentary less seriously. It's impressive that even amidst all the sensationalism and gore that occupies the final act we still find ourselves enthralled and empathetic toward Bol and Rial's absolution. 

If ""House"" has a flaw, it's that, as a horror movie, it's not especially scary or thrilling. Weekes' gift as a storyteller, at least as far as this film goes, seems to lie with drama, which made me wonder if ""House"" would have rendered more powerful by using a genre other than horror as its chief platform. The production design, cinematography and special effects are convincing and competently executed, and they technically make this a horror movie, but they also come across as more sufficient than exciting. The drama and characters overshadow them, which is a good thing overall, but even so, the movie didn't frighten me the way Weekes likely intended.

In spite of this minor shortcoming, ""His House"" resonates with us and is a worthy entry in the field of social commentating films that use traditional genres to make relevant points. It's reassuring to think films such as ""Get Out"" and ""His House"" are being made more frequently and the studios funding seem inspired by their messages. Films like these make us think, feel, empathize, and react but also allow us to sit back and be entertained. That's a paradoxical combination but also a welcome one.",His House

3,"‚ÄúYour ghosts follow you. They never leave. They live with you. It's when I let them in, I could start to face myself.‚Äù His House is about a refugee couple that make a harrowing escape from war-torn South Sudan, but then they struggle to adjust to their new life in an English town that has an evil lurking beneath the surface. As a horror piece, this had the elements to make an effective experience. Storytelling is where it stands out. The premise is based off of a story from their background. There‚Äôs a long monologue that tells it all in a great way. What it also utilizes is the fact of passing down stories from culture and generation. Going back into our characters‚Äô past lives furthers the experience. It‚Äôs less of a dramatic past but more of a horror story of war and loss. A scene that captures a war zone experience is one of the best action scenes out there. Between the agony and how the scene is filmed, I couldn‚Äôt have wished for a better directed scene. I don‚Äôt know the story behind writer/director Remi Weekes but this must be a personal story for him to tell. Above all this is a story of what refugees must face after their given sanctuary. Actors Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku really did well. They‚Äôre a great duo together and the essence of their character are portray perfectly. You wonder if what they are seeing is real or just a product of PTSD. What I found most interesting is the complex they live in. It‚Äôs a character itself. As it‚Äôs torn apart slowly, it doesn‚Äôt just look great but also is done with purpose. Another scene uses the deteriorating walls to transition into a war zone. Everything is all meaningful. That‚Äôs what makes this movie good. Sometimes I wish it could be just a little better. This is a more personal note for me but I wasn‚Äôt always the most interested in what was happening. I appreciated everything but the slow paced scenes didn‚Äôt always keep my attention. But I really do think this is a good movie. Horror should really aspire to be as meaningful as His House.

4,"Eerie atmosphere, psychologically disturbing, the movie focuses on how a past crime could shatter a man's conscience. Quite a fantastic performance, I must say.",His House
3,"I wish I could say that I liked this movie more than I did. My anticipation was that this was going to be an allegory of sorts about the immigration experience but as a native born Brit, I didn't find that it gave me any kind of glimpse into what that would be like. 
I get the metaphors and symbolism and the constant flashbacks show some sliver of the path to where they ended up and I get the feeling of being torn between their home (regardless of how deadly and dangerous it was) and the desire for a new life. 
But in the end, there was very little shared about what it's like aside from the (almost extraneous) demons and ghosts. Or witch. 
From a story standpoint, it simply wasn't that compelling of a narrative. The acting was incredible, remarkable. That's what saved this from what otherwise started to feel like a scyfy movie at times. 
CGI and effects were solid (if not excessive and unnecessary...the dramatic scenes were cool but added very little in the way of elaborating on the story or the experience) and cinematography was well done. 
In the end it just felt like there was this movie that was going to somehow share the experience of an immigrant coming to England and it was an opportunity for others to understand something they could otherwise never understand. 
But after watching it I don't feel like I got a glimpse into it in any way that would help me better grasp it. 
Certainly wrapping a horrifying experience (because I've no doubt it is one) into a horror movie seems to make sense but I would have preferred a story about the experience without the dramatic monsters and demons and still don't get the message tucked into a that vs the loss of the daughter. 
I could see why some people would see it as a depiction of how immigrants take their opportunities in other nations for granted. This story fed into that at first clearly  and whether that's an intrinsic part of the immigration process or not, it cloudies the narrative to throw those instances into the movie about wanting to go back after they'd been given an opportunity that sims many people have literally died to have a shot at.",His House

1,"I don't know HOW this movie gets 100%??!! It's not even close! This is probably one of the worst horror movies out there. The 1st issue is the refugee housing. We know that refugees don't get put into crap housing like the one in the film, in fact they get put into fairly nice looking homes and the homes usually start to look dilapidated AFTER they've lived there. Secondly, the ""friendliness"" or lack thereof rather, is untrue. In general people in the UK don't treat refugees with THAT amount of disdain as seen in the film. It's as though the film is trying to make the English feel guilty for not showing enough ""friendliness"" towards refugees, when in fact that is simply NOT true. Thirdly, the overall ""haunted house"" story is stale as it's been done so many times and the film adds nothing new to that narrative. Lastly, the acting is very average (bordering on poor) and the 2 leads have very little chemistry. My verdict: half a star, but I'll give it an extra half star for visual effects (which is also fairly average as well). Final verdict: 1 star",His House
5,Absolutely stunningly beautiful and truly terrifying mixture of atmosphere and jump scares. Frightening on so many different levels. It's unfortunate that this film was brigaded by anti-refugee fascists.,His House
3,"His House is a pretty solid effort with lots of spooky surprises and enough clever jump scares to justify a watch ‚Äî even if you'll see the ending coming a mile away.

At the center of this social issue horror are Sudanese refugees who've gone through hell and back to escape their war torn homeland for a new life in England. Only hell isn't quite done with them. While trying to make themselves at home in this strange new country, their house begins to torment them with clever, and refreshingly brutal, hauntings each night. I won't spoil the details here, but I was quite impressed with the scale of the scary sequences, especially for what's clearly a smaller budget movie (three leads, two main locations) that saved its production dollars to really elevate its set-pieces. 

It's no secret that I'm 100% ""in the bag"" when it comes to physical FX, and there are some gruesome molds and visuals here (particularly in the final act) that were awesomely creepy. Kudos to the FX team! 

I must also call out the main actress, Sop√© D√¨r√≠s√π, who gave a heartbreaking performance. The script could have easily turned her into a sobbing mother stereotype, but she carries the film's emotional center without it ever feeling maudlin. I expect to see her in more movies in the future; she has great screen presence.

For a while, I thought the title had an obvious double meaning, and maybe it does... a little bit... but that would be too easy for a film that clearly has bigger aspirations than the obvious.",His House
5,really good movie where horror with a good storyline has been beautifully combined and crafted. To pick up on the issue of refugees escaping war and wrapping around a horror story was amazing and courageous. The acting was impressive.

4,A very unusual perspective. The horror of the refugee experience.,His House
1,All these great reviews had me fooled. Rubbish. But after watching and realising the self hate of certain people I understood the 100%. Everything is our fault. We must bend and self flagellate for problems that had already been there from time immemorial. No thanks. This stunk.,His House
4,"The more empathetic you are as a person, the more you're able to immerse yourself within the story of a horror film, or any film for that matter‚Ä¶placing yourself in the shoes of the characters being chased down by zombies or tormented by demons. You imagine what it might be like, or try to figure out what YOU would do in such a situation, and maybe even shed a tear when somebody gets slaughtered on camera. It's all part of the cinematic experience, and empathy can really amplify that experience. 

However, for some people, it might be difficult to truly imagine what it must feel like for a refugee landing in another country. It's an entire story in itself, and one with far more horror elements than you might think, depending on the journey. And when you toss in an evil entity lurking beneath the surface, it really puts you to the test. 

'His House' was written and directed by Remi Weekes, who had never made a feature film prior to this. That makes it all the more impressive that he was able to pull together what I think is not just the best horror film of 2020, but one of the best films of the year, period. But for some reason, too many people have never even heard of 'His House,' let alone seen it. And that's a shame, because this is the sort of film we need to see more of within the horror genre, which is often overcrowded with bad B-movies or Hollywood features hellbent on making a buck rather than telling a gripping story of any real substance.

'His House' centers around Bol and Rial, a couple from Sudan who are seeking asylum in London, following a treacherous journey across the Mediterranean that nearly left them dead. They've been given a second chance at life in London, where they are assigned low-income housing in a rough neighbourhood. They can't get jobs, are faced with strict restrictions, and are given a small amount of money to live off each week. To make things worse, their new home is situated on the outskirts of London and is plagued by peeling wallpaper, shabby furnishings, and trash lining their front lawn. Still, it's a blessing compared to the war-torn bloodbath of their homeland. 

Bol is fixated on assimilation, eager and desperate to fit into this new world, while Rial seems like a fish out of water, struggling to find her place here. As they try to settle into their new surroundings, it becomes clear that they aren't alone, as something sinister lingers within the walls of their new home. As the terror escalates, we discover a dark secret that has been haunting the couple ever since they escaped Sudan, one that they must make right before it's too late. 

There is nothing bad I can say about this film. The story is distinct and relevant, the acting (namely the leads Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku) is superb, the visuals are outstanding, and the horror elements are on par with some of the best horror films of this last decade. We get to experience something special here, in that this is a totally original story backed by a stellar cast and crew, helmed by an up-and-coming filmmaker ready to make his mark. 

'His House,' which premiered in early 2020 at the Sundance Film Festival, was picked up by Netflix soon after and released that Halloween. Fortunately, it's still available to stream; so, I recommend you seek this one out, because it's a rare gem of a movie that deserves to be regarded as one of the best the horror realm has to offer.",His House

3,3 out of 5 stars. His House is a fair horror film that does offer some scares and jump scares which will keep your heart pounding. But the story is shallow as it tries something new and direction is dull and bleak that does make it difficult to sit through. The plot is about a couple who was able to escape from an hostile country in Africa. Able to get shelter in England with a probation period to pass through the immigration laws. They move into a house. Until they begin experiencing some haunting noises and sightings. There is more to the plot without giving away spoilers which focuses on the couple and there tragic losses they dealt with escaping. The film does have several creepy and scary moments that will get your adrenaline going when the couple run into ghostly figures or strange sightings. The performances were decent with the cast ensemble. The direction is also decent which feels shallow and could have been so much more. While it feels forgettable to any other horror movie.,His House
5,"A brilliant movie! Such a fresh take on a horror film that leaves you thinking and wanting to talk to someone after.

3,"A unique premise for horror that twists the cliche of moving into a ""haunted house"". There is some effective cinematography that greatly helps certain scenes of horror, though they're few and far between. I can't exactly call this a horror, though, as it falls more into the category of drama with horror elements. There're some interesting messages about acculturation woven in here. I was a bit disappointed as I was expecting more from it in terms of horror. So, all in all, some scarce but effective moments of horror and some interesting messages make for an above average film.",His House
5,"It may be difficult to imagine now, but in 1938 and 1939, Katharine Hepburn was extremely unpopular with Hollywood and with the American public. A string of box office failures, coupled with her abrasive and combative behavior with the press and fans, had garnered her a reputation for being extremely arrogant. Seeking to reignite her career she returned to the stage, starring in a new play by Philip Barry. That play was The Philadelphia Story. She would perform the role of socialite Tracy Lord in two tours and on Broadway for over a year. When Hollywood decided to produce the play as a movie, Hepburn had already purchased the rights to the story (thanks to help from Howard Hughes), so she was guaranteed the role. Teaming with Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart for the movie version of the play, Hepburn's shrewd selection of this vehicle paid off. The Philadelphia Story would become one of the biggest movies of 1940, and Hepburn's career and public perception were back on track.

Tracy is a divorcee living with her parents and her precocious younger sister, and she is engaged to be married again. This go-around she will marry George Kittredge, a dull businessman who dotes on her but who is out of place in the world of wealth which Tracy is accustomed to. When word of the wedding gets out, the publisher of Spy Magazine sends reporter Mike Connor (Stewart) and his girlfriend, photographer Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), to cover it. To help facilitate getting Mike and Liz the inside scoop, the publisher is sending another employee of Spy Magazine with them. That employee is C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), Tracy Lord's first husband!

This is screwball comedy at its finest. Hepburn is at the top of her game as she plays cat-and-mouse with Mike and Liz when they first meet Tracy. Soon, it becomes unclear who Tracy will end up with, as she discovers the depths of reporter Mike which she wasn't expecting. The two of them share a drunken evening together, the night before her wedding is supposed to take place. And of course, her feelings for her first husband are also reignited. While you know from the get-go that Tracy is never going to marry George‚Ä¶ what you don't know is who she will end up with, or if she will end up with anyone at all. The suspense of how the tale will end beautifully lasts right up to the last few minutes of the movie. 

This is one of those truly iconic films that every true movie buff should see. It's one I'm disappointed I never made time for in the past. It is also one I will most certainly watch again. This is an undeniably perfect marriage of comedy storytelling, filmmaking, and acting.",The Philadelphia Story
5,"This movie has always been in my top five - maybe even top 3. Rotten Tomatoes is spot on with a 100% rating. Extremely funny. The scene between Cary Grant and a ‚Äòdrunk' Jimmy Stewart is hilarious. Grant was truly trying not to break character when you see him smile & start to laugh at Stewart.  Very ‚Äòtongue in cheek' humor that is never meant to be taken seriously. If you do take it seriously, you have sadly missed the entire point of the movie.",The Philadelphia Story
4,The banter in many movies from the 40s rings contrived and a little dated.  Not so here.  The dialog is intelligent and sharp with good acting performances all around.,The Philadelphia Story
4,"The Philadelphia Story was a curious choice of film for reviving the flagging fortunes of its lead star, Katharine Hepburn.  It seems hard to believe now, but in the 1930s she was widely regarded as box office poison.  Films such as Bringing Up Baby and Holiday are highly-regarded today, but were unpopular at the time.

Undaunted, Hepburn sought to make a comeback by buying the film rights to a stage play in which she had starred with some success. That film was The Philadelphia Story. She recruited the talented director of ‚Äòwoman's films' (as he was labelled, rather against his wishes), George Cukor. Cukor had previously directed Hepburn in a number of films.

The film also boasted a star cast, including Cary Grant and James Stewart. However it was essentially a vehicle for Hepburn to regain her fame. With her standing quite low at the time, Hepburn agreed to waive her salary and take 45% of the profits instead. Her gamble paid off. The Philadelphia Story was the fifth most popular film of the year, and Hepburn secured an Oscar nomination.

Of course the movie in many ways played to Hepburn's strengths. She was playing a haughty but vulnerable rich woman, not unlike herself. Nonetheless the philosophy of the film was one that was very different from that of the progressive Hepburn. The Philadelphia Story is an amusing movie that has a wonderful cast on sparkling form and a capable director. 

It also expresses a socially conservative outlook on life. Usually the movies come down on the side of the underdog, perhaps with a canny understanding that most of the audience for the film will not be particularly wealthy. Here is a film that takes the side of the rich, a side that hardly needs defending, many might feel.

Has there ever been a movie that contains so much dialogue in which so many men get to criticise a woman for being too independent? Tracy receives some criticism from the women in her family, but most of it comes from the men.

Tracy's father blames his womanising on his daughter, a position that she indignantly denies at first, but which appears to be supported by the film. Before the story ends, it is she who apologises to him for being a disappointment, and a reconciliation between daughter and father is established, but on his terms.

Dexter too condemns Tracy's behaviour. Never mind his alcoholism. It is Tracy who was the problem in their marriage. ""She's a girl who's generous to a fault,"" Dexter says satirically; ""Except to other people's faults. For instance, she never had any understanding of my deep and gorgeous thirst."" Some would feel that living with an alcoholic is a difficult task for any woman, but in the world of The Philadelphia Story, it is evidence that Tracy ""finds human imperfection unforgivable"".

A running theme in this criticism is the perceived lack of femininity in Tracy. ""I used to be afraid of that look ‚Äì the withering glance of the goddess,"" Dexter sneers. Similarly he suggests that she expected his role in the marriage to be that of a ""high priest to a virgin goddess"". He suggests she belongs to a special class of ""married maidens"".

In describing the attitudes towards class and gender in The Philadelphia Story, I may have presented a dry picture of a film with hopelessly outdated and objectionable views, that can have no appeal to the modern viewer. In fact this is not the case. Allowing for a few troubling passages of dialogue, the film still seems fresh and lively today, and it is a pleasure to watch.

The film's problematic criticisms of Tracy Lord's strong personality and lack of conventional femininity have not prevented the film from being loved by women as well as men. The film may staunchly defend the virtues of the upper class, but it remains appealing to people from all backgrounds.

How can that be? The enduring charm of a movie relies on its finding something that all people can find relatable. In the case of The Philadelphia Story, there are a number of redeeming qualities. There is the star appeal of Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart, all performing at the top of their abilities. There is the literate and humorous script that brings the characters to life.

The message of the film too has something universal about it. The film rightly recognises that the good qualities of a person transcend class, and it calls on people to learn to forgive others, and to be understanding of human weakness.

5,"The acting is excellent. While Grant is very good in this the movie belongs too Hepburn & Stewart who have excellent chemistry and are bubbly and charming together in every scene. The rest of the supporting cast is good also. Overall the acting is phenomenal. The music is the one weak point, while its good when used it isn't used enough. Which makes it a big surprise that this never comes across as dry. This is actually excellently paced. The firs bit just throws us into the plot and than we get back story on everyone. While this is a bit jarring at first once Hepburn & Stewart start interacting the film never lets up and builds perfectly. The editing is excellent also weaving effortlessly between the 3 love interests, Hepburn, and the writing story. The writing story surprisingly becomes a subplot and the romance takes over. The cinematography is excellent. While this the camerawork is solid but nothing special and in black and white it manages to shine because of the memorable setting and amazing chemistry of the leads and the beauty of Hepburn is always in focus. Add in witty dialogue and some light hearted humor and each scene lights up with charm especially as things progress. The only knocks I can give this is I wish it had more music, and a little more development between Connor and Smith but that's about it. Everyone should give this a try once.",The Philadelphia Story

1,"Would put 0 stars if I could. This movie basically romanticizes the relationship between Hepburn and a man that beats her. Worse, there are jokes all along about how he might ""sock"" her again. The act of the violence we see at the beginning is normalized throughout the movie. This was certainly not ok, even in the 40s. To me this made the plot puke-worthy. I am not for cancelling movies retroactively but this has to be one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen.

The line and scene writing in this movie is something I cannot explain. I'm not sure if any of the lines were improvised but they seemed too realistic. The poolside scene with Jim Stewart and Katherine Hepburn is probably my favorite movie scene of all time.

The supporting actors also deserve credit for creating a realistic upscale mansion dwelling crowd.",The Philadelphia Story
3,"One of the first productions on rom-coms. Although the film was great in a general sense and actors were spectacular, I believe that the resolution might have been reached in a better way.

Kate said that the character of Tracy Samantha Lord was the closest to her in real-life of all the characters she ever played. Cary Grant appeared at her explicit demand (MGM was not Grant's studio).

So I Google High Society and learn that High Society is the musical remake of A Philadelphia Story. Well there were a few differences and I enjoyed both movies, but High Society was better. Grace Kelly was better than Hepburn and that is the more important role in the movie. Jimmy Stewart was the best in this movie and I felt like Cary Grant didn't even want to make this movie.

4,"Jimmy Stewart: ""You had been drinking, so we didn't do anything.""
Katherine Hepburn: ""Why, am I not pretty?""

Cherrypicking the best of the acting talent of the A-listers of Hollywood's Golden Age for its three leads and providing some exceptionally clever and biting dialogue for the time, The Philadelphia Story is a major landmark in popular American film. Grant is charming as all get-out, Hepburn brings a sharp wit to stage a career resurgence, Stewart is characteristically wholesome, and Hussey leads the supporting cast with a memorably barbed and aloof peformance that earned her an Oscar nom despite her relatively brief appearance. That said, it's got some weaknesses; parts of the romantic dynamic are woefully dated, and some aspects of the plot are a bit convoluted for their own good (the switched identities, for one). As far as I'm concerned, nothing can take the crown from Capra's It Happened One Night and the pure chemistry between Gable and Colbert for the top pre-war rom-com, but The Philadelphia Story is still a memorable and above all well-acted standout of the genre.

4,"Playing possibly the most quintessential Katharine Hepburn role of her career one of the most famous actresses of all time gives an iconic performance in a role that feels tailor made for her. She is the primary selling point of the film and I couldn't help loving her but the film boasts many other charms. However much like another Hepburn classic, Woman of the Year (1942), it really botches it's ending as it cuts down what would have been a great feminist tale. Is it one of the 100 greatest films ever made? No, not at all but it is a fun romantic comedy that is likely to appeal to all audiences, young and old.

Philadelphian socialite and tabloid fixture Tracy Lord, Katharine Hepburn, has been divorced from her alcoholic ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven, Cary Grant, for two years and plans to wed the self made but dispassionate Geoge Kittredge, John Howard. Haven arranges to have disgruntled reporter Mike Connor, James Stewart, and his co-worker Elizabeth Imbrie, Ruth Hussey, cover the wedding under the guise of being his close friends. Lord figures out this deception quickly and chooses to present herself a certain way so that the articles covering her will be positive. Her aggression when it comes to her relationships with men proves to be derived from her father Seth, John Halliday, having publicly had many affairs that have hurt her mother and brought shame upon the family. She begins falling in love with the goofy Connor but Imbrie harbors an attraction to him and the passion is clearly still alive between Lord and Haven. She comes to regret some of her past actions and is humbled as the men around her inform her of the pain she has caused and ultimately calls of her wedding to Kittredge and remarries Haven.

Describing the wonder of Hepburn's work is difficult because to most it may seem as though she is just playing herself. I would contend that she does play on the public persona she has built up but injects a vulnerability into her portrayal that wasn't there in previous Hepburn vehicles. Probably driven by the fact that she was making a comeback and had been rejected by Hollywood she is a woman of great talents forced to admit her flaws. She also displays her tremendous comic timing as few actresses can enunciate as well as she can and simply a repetition of the word ""Swim"" elicits great laughter. Her damaged, wounded pride shines through when she is attacked by her father, a character that the film likes but I hated, and her torture at seeing her mother, whom she tenderly cares for, become subservient to him. We are as enchanted by her as all of her male suitors are as she is a queen and a goddess in equal measure.

Stewart is quite lovely as the daffy competition to her ex-husband and it is easy to see why he became the leading man of the 1940s. He has great chemistry with Hepburn and the two radiate sexuality during the famous drunk sequence in the film but I imagine that few actors could have made this odd little writer quite so appealing. Grant is a bit of a letdown, as he often is for me, with his love interest seeming stolid and dull and he is easily overshadowed by supporting players like Hussey who has one of the best moments in the entire film when she notes that Connor has some growing up to do before he is good enough to be with her. 

Where the film lost me was in it's ending as the ideas that I believed it was supporting and it's presentation of the strong, capable Lord are suddenly subverted to damning effect. Her father has a horrifying monologue in which he blames his daughter and wife for his infidelity and suggests that only a meek, subservient daughter will do. I was disgusted by this and I believed that the film was too but Lord later apologizes to her father, for what I do not know, and returns to Haven who has very obvious problems in being an alcoholic that justify her divorcing him. I understand that under the Hays Code you couldn't portray divorce positively and a comedy of remarriage was a way to get around certain restrictions but they did not have to hammer home the sexist ideas so heavily.",The Philadelphia Story
5,"Effervescent and beguiling, it's easy to be carried away by the screenplay's whirlwind wit and the magnetic chemistry of the three legendary leads. Stewart may have won the Oscar for his sly performance, one of the finest drunks ever put on screen, but it's Hepburn who is given the fullest range and richest (in both senses) character, and this is among the best turns, perhaps the most definitive one, in her long career. Yet there is also an ambivalent, bold, and complicated depiction of class antagonism and gender norms just beneath the surface story that transforms this quadrangle comedy of manners into a still more clever social satire.",The Philadelphia Story
5,"Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, Ruth Hussey, John Howard, Roland Young, John Halliday, Virginia Weidler, Mary Nash, Henry Daniell, Hillary Brooke. Talky but brilliant adaptation of Philip Barry's hit Broadway comedy about society girl who yearns for down-to-earth romance; Grant is her ex-husband, Stewart a fast-talking reporter who falls in love with her. Entire cast is excellent, but Stewart really shines in his offbeat, Academy Award winning role. Donald Ogden Stewart's script also earned an Oscar. Later musicalized as HIGH SOCIETY.",The Philadelphia Story
4,"Reviewed 6.1.19  Perhaps the best of the 'comedy of remarriage' genre.  Crazy to think that as late as the 1940's, American movies were not permitted to depict extramarital affairs.  My how times have changed.  It's also noteworthy that Katherine Hepburn's character being aggressively pushed in the face to the ground by her husband is actually a comedic point of reference.  Yikes.  Those ""that's how it was then"" observances aside, The Philadelphia Story is a thoroughly pleasant viewing experience.  

Jimmy Stewart's only Oscar-winning performance is a hoot, displaying a range of emotion from disdain to goofy, but in a likable manner all his own.  After a successful Broadway run in the same role, Hepburn is sharp as Tracy Lord, a wealthy socialite that learns love isn't about being worshipped, it's about opening up.  As her wedding day approaches, pesky Mike Connor (Stewart) and Ruth Hussey (wonderful as Liz Imbrie) track her every move for an unwelcome tabloid spread.  And C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant) finds joy in stirring the emotional pot.  

It's at once old-fashioned but also feels fresh, given Donald Ogden Stewart's Academy Award winning script.  A mash-up of romantic comedy tropes of the past, with a dash of what they would become in the future.  Both staid and playful, in an envelope-pushing way for the time period.  For those that like to connect the creative dots of film history, The Philadelphia Story is on the line.",The Philadelphia Story

4,"One of the things I love most about the Criterion Collection is how it provides the means and reasonable excuse to take a respite from the blockbusters that dominate popular culture. Their commitment to providing the discerning cinephile with examples of the most illuminating and enjoyable examples of cinema as a creative means of artistic expression. From the classic film presentation of the genic embodied by the works of William Shakespeare to the definitive gangster movies of the forties and creature flicks of the fifties, the Criterion Collection has continually stood out as a place to enjoy the creativity of the best auteurs whoever peered through a lens. Frequently. When I receive a new member of the illustrious list for review, it is a film I may not have seen for many years if ever at all. Most recently this was the case with 'The Philadelphia Story.' Released in 1940 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), it was a part of Hollywood's contribution to the war effort. Film at that time played he invaluable service of helping to keep morale up, and people hopeful. Typically, this was done in one of two ways. Dramas, mysteries, and thrillers reinforced the jingoistic confidence that our morally right cause will prevail. The popular alternative was to offer a distraction from rationing, battles occupying headlines on every newspaper and radio broadcast. This movie possesses a timeless quality that is derived from superior writing, exemplary direction, and performances from a cast of iconic performers. It will be of interest to fans of that most popular of date movies, the romantic comedy. Aficionados of the rom-com are certain to be fascinated by comparing a rom-com with modern stars, for example, Katherine Heigl and an actress from the golden age of Hollywood, Katharine Hepburn. Among the most obvious differences is that Ms. Hepburn was accomplished in a broad variety of genres. She is just one member of an amazing actor, each one worthy of their A-List status.

The Lord family has held a prominent position in Philadelphia society for as far back as that illustrious lineage extended. The eldest daughter Tracy (Katharine Hepburn)), had been married to wealthy yacht designer, C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant). Although he was on par socially, the marriage encountered irreconcilable differences and the couple divorced. Younger members of the audience are admonished to keep in mind that at that time divorce was infrequent and had serious, negative social stigma associated. The extreme action was undertaken as C.K. was unable to maintain the exacting standards of conduct demanded by the Lord family. He had a penchant for a drink which was exacerbated by the family's constant pressure to quit. After permitting a suitable couple of years to pass Tracy was engaged to George Kittredge (John Howard). A match was technically suitable as George did come from an affluent family, but it was tainted but the social faux pas of being nouveau riche and being popular among the common throng. True wealth, derived from money inherited through generations, never lowered themselves to associate with the lower caste. The need to be explicated stated wasn't necessary, but the audience would understand that a divorced woman would be unsuitable for the most desirable young men topping the social register. Still, George's popularity with the people was certain to turn the nuptials into a media circus.

'Entertainment news' and paparazzi are now a new contrivance, they have existed for as long as one group of people were held in higher esteem and bestowed with elevated social status. If this story were told today, the next player in the tale would be held by TMZ or 'E! News'. In the forties, the primary source of innuendo, rumors, blind headlines, and gossip were the Hollywood fan magazines. The commitment to journalistic integrity and the veracity of their sources were secondary to obtaining the scoop and increasing distribution. The dubious representative of the fourth estate in this story is a gossip magazine Spy. Its publisher, Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell), is anxious beat out the competition by securing the location and other details of the pending nuptials. To this end, he assigns reporter Macaulay ""Mike"" Connor (James Stewart) and photographer Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey). The requisite twist that drives the confusion of the genre, the secret identity reveal, mistaking one individual for another, to a contrived plot to purposely deceive. The chosen plot contrivance utilized here is the unknown job. When a character is engaged in a job or career that potentially compromises the core relationship.

As George is from new money, he was still in need of a job, if not for the essentials of life than for something to occupy the endless hours of prosperous tedium. He had been working for Spy in South America and is to introduce Mike and Liz into the venue. Many movie genres have undergone some changes in the defining criteria, but the venerable romantic comedy has endured largely unaltered. The fundamental formula is bringing the couple together, induce the same relationship threatening stressor or deception and pull them back together. This movie initially premiered over seventy-five years ago. The romcoms enjoyed when this audience's grand or even great grandparents were dating. Terms such as iconic are tossed about, but not many categories of the film were so well defined three-quarters of a century ago. The plot concocted by George is to introduce Mike and Liz as friends of Tracy's brother Junius, who is a U.S. diplomat in Argentina. Tracy expresses her refusal to be complicit. George threatens to release a salacious story exposing her father, Seth's (John Halliday), affair with a dancer. His cheating, while not publicly known, had been the cause of Tracy's parents sleeping in different bedrooms.In the current proliferation of divorce much of the stigma has been ameliorated, but in the forties, u=it was admitting to an intrinsic failure often perceived as a character flaw. For the social elite, it was certain to diminish the family ranking considerably. What is fascinating, from the vantage point of a new millennium, is to examine how its possible to present so many identical tropes, circumstances, and archetypes with the context of such dissimilar societal norms and moral restrictions. Arguably a case can be made the romantic comedy is firmly based on the inherent facets of human nature that it can resist the vagaries of changes in social structure over long periods of time. Tracy relents allowing the reporter and photographer to remain.

Right on cue, the audience is pulled into cinematic geometry as the sides of the mandatory romantic triangle is formed. Tracy discovers a book of short stories written by Mike finder herself enamored by him. On the night before the ceremony Tracy gets drunk, only the second time she has been in a state of inebriation. The diminished self-control resulted in a midnight swim with Mike. A modern romcom, even one with a mild rating of PG-13, would inevitably be highly suggestive of some inappropriate state of undress. This is one aspect of movies that have suffered from the greater contextual freedom. With the strict Hayes Code of 1930 in full effect, even the hint of such impropriety was unthinkable. The filmmaker had to be cleaver in getting adult themes across to the audience while eschewing any hint of adult content. The director of the perennial classic was George Cukor, the master of movie romance in its multitude of forms. Besides the comedic format Mr. Cukor made his mark in the romantic drama, 'A Star is Born (1954) and the musical, 'My Fair Lady (1964). He received five Academy Award nominations over the course of his career winning Best Director for 'My Fair Lady.' The romantic comedy may currently be considered on a lower tier than other movies, but a film like this provide proof of their lasting contribution to the art form.

4,"The Philadelphia Story Review
	The Philadelphia Story is a brilliant rom com. It's smart, funny, emotional, romantic and so much more. Much of this comes from its brilliant screenplay (its Oscar win was well deserved) and the actors who make it come to life. The story is a creative twist on classic tropes (for example, rather than a love triangle it has an odd love polygon, featuring three potential suitors competing for Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord and a sub-triangle surrounding James Stewart's Macaulay Connors), the dialogue is clever and witty, and the humor works extremely well. It is a wild, fast-paced joyride of a film, but it manages to never get the audience lost along the way, even through multiple faked identities and misunderstandings among the characters. 
	Much of the credit for the success of The Philadelphia Story goes to the actors. Its central figures are played Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, and Cary Grant, all undeniable titans of filmmaking. The manic pacing of the film presents a challenge to these actors, as they need to be over the top to meet the demands of the script, but going too far makes the film hokey and unbelieveable. Luckily, the film delivers on the promise of its billing, with each of the three leads delivering a stellar performance. The film is also stocked with scene stealing supporting players such as Ruth Hussey, Roland Young, and Virginia Weidler, each one adding to the merits of an already excellent film.
	The Philadelphia Story fits into a number of subgenres. While it is most associated the remarriage subgenre, in which a divorced couple rediscovers love, much to the chagrin of their current romantic partners (ex. His Girl Friday), but it also fits into the wedding subgenre in which one of the romantic leads is about to get married to another person and the other lead has to break up the wedding (ex.  The Wedding Singer, Made of Honor), and the journalism subgenre, in which one of the romantic leads is tasked with writing a story about the other and in doing so falls in love (ex. It Happened One Night, 27 Dresses). Ultimately, this subgenre transcendence reflects one of the more fascinating traits of The Philadelphia Story: it is a conglomeration of a number of classic rom com themes. It explores the relationship between social class and romance, definitions of manhood and masculinity, the validity of marriage, and female sexual agency, to name a few. Dealing with so many issues often could dilute each of them; however, the confused and manic nature of the film makes this compounded exploration of issues successful. The hectic pace implies that all of these anxieties coming up at once is in itself an anxiety unto itself.
	To the extent that The Philadelphia Story doesn't get the attention it deserves, it can only be attributed to the fact that it is often overshadowed by its central player's other output. Each of the three leads was incredibly successful both before and after The Philadelphia Story, collectively appearing in films such on the level of Bringing up Baby, His Girl Friday, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life, Vertigo, North by Northwest, and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, to only name films from the top of my head. However, The Philadelphia Story is a phenomenal achievement and not one to be missed.",The Philadelphia Story
5,"With three of the most iconic stars of their time, The Philadelphia Story manages to be sweet, but quite funny in marriage.",The Philadelphia Story
4,"A memorable mashup of talented 1940s Hollywood A-listers in front of the same camera, this pulls through with its classic love triangle and witty humor.",The Philadelphia Story
4,"What a delightful movie this is - loaded with star power, clever dialog, and a script that keeps us guessing.  The first scene, where Cary Grant is shown leaving his wife Katharine Hepburn with no words spoken, sets the tone.  As Hepburn plans to remarry, Grant seeks to get revenge on her by sneaking a reporter (Jimmy Stewart) and photographer (Ruth Hussey) into her home on the wedding weekend.  

Stewart is brilliant in the role from beginning to end.  He's upset over being there in the first place, as he's a serious writer who has been asked to write a trashy tabloid story, and he's not a big fan of the well-to-do either.  The scene early on where he examines the silver, thinking he's alone, and is confronted by the butler, is hilarious.  Later he dials up another room within the home at random and says ""This is the bridal suite, would you send up a couple of caviar sandwiches and a bottle of beer?""  When asked who he is, he then says ""This is the voice of Doom calling.  Your days are numbered 'til the seventh son of the seventh son,"" before hanging up.  He has other comic scenes early on, including asking the librarian ""Dost thou have a washroom?"" after sensing her formality.

I just loved how the film wrong foots us, as we expect it to go in a direction of these two being undercover spies with all sorts of similar antics throughout the weekend.  Instead, Hepburn immediately sees through the ruse, and proceeds to hilariously torture the pair with questions of her own.  Along the way an uncle will be assigned the identity of the father, only to have the father show up unexpectedly himself.  Hepburn's much younger little sister (Virginia Weidler) is part of the fun, at one point going up to the piano with a gleam in her eye, and busting out a raucous tune: ""Lydia, oh Lydia, say have you met Lydia?  Oh Lydia, the tattooed lady.   She has eyes that folks adore so, and a torso even more so...""

Throughout all this madcap chaos, the script is fast-paced and clever.  For example, in response to her mother asking if there's no privacy anymore, Hepburn quips, ""Only in bed, mother, and not always there.""  I also loved it when she referred to the poet Li Bai at one point: ""There was a Chinese poet who was drowned while trying to kiss the moon in the river.  He was drunk....but he wrote beautiful poetry.""  More importantly, there are observations on character and love.  The father (John Halliday) tries to explain an older man's attraction to a younger woman, and even though he seems like a rake, there's something to what he says.  The film takes a serious turn when he and Grant both say some devastating things to Hepburn about her insensitivity, and the hurt in her reaction shows her acting prowess.  

With all of that said, I think it was really Jimmy Stewart who really made this movie special with two wonderful scenes.  The first is where he's drunk and goes over to Grant's place, which is an absolute classic.  The scene was unrehearsed, what we see was the first take, and it includes a couple of improvisations - Stewart hiccupping, and Grant quipping ""Excuse me.""  The look in Stewart's eyes really make us feel that he's drunk, and that we're getting a glimpse at two friends (the actors themselves) having fun.  In fact, the way Stewart looks at people throughout the movie - the butler, the librarian, Grant, and Hepburn - is just fantastic, and still makes me smile thinking about it.

The second amazing scene is when he and Hepburn (who's also drunk) realize they're in love.  ""A magnificence that comes out of your eyes, in your voice, in the way you stand there, in the way you walk. You're lit from within, Tracy. You've got fires banked down in you, hearth-fires and holocausts,"" he says.  She answers, ""I don't seem to you made of bronze?"", a reference to one of the cruel things that's been said to her, and he responds, ""No, you're made out of flesh and blood. That's the blank, unholy surprise of it. You're the golden girl, Tracy. Full of life and warmth and delight..."".  When he kisses her, she emits a beautiful ""golly,"" and later, before they dash off across the lawn, she says ""put me in your pocket, Mike.""  It's a wonderful, romantic scene.  Oh, and I should say, the lines they say to each other earlier in the evening - ""Hello you... You look fine"", ""I feel fine"" are just lovely too. 

It's for that reason that I have to say, I was a bit disappointed in Hepburn's choice at the end.  The evening before she does say ""The time to make up your mind about people is never"", and it is in the spirit of a reconciliation which grows, but just doesn't feel right.  Aside from her feeling the blame for her ex-husband's alcoholism (the nerve of her not understanding him better!), the real passion and chemistry is with Stewart.  With that said though, it's a delightful movie, and the story behind its making and Katharine Hepburn's resurrection is a real testament to her intelligence.",The Philadelphia Story

Amazing one liners and comebacks, Katherine Hepburn looking peak beautiful and acting like a goddamn hero, Jimmy Stewart thinking he could somehow in any universe pull her, Cary Grant's face, a NOT(!) annoying child character, and a great running commentary on how men are terrible even though it tries to walk it back at the end a bit to keep itself safe for 1940 but I see u movie, I see u.",The Philadelphia Story

2,"Pretty boring movie, with mediocre writing. But, the acting and story was okay. It just didn't keep my attention",The Philadelphia Story
4,"The Philadelphia Story consists of three super-heavyweight actors √¢?? Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart √¢?? showing us how to fall in love on the big screen in pinball fashion. Hepburn stars as the wealthy socialite Tracy Lord who has divorced her family√¢??s favourite man for her, Grant√¢??s Dexter Haven, is set to marry nouveau riche Mr Kittredge, but ends up flirting with Stewart√¢??s reporter assigned to cover the wedding, and suddenly cannot find herself to decide which man is the one for her. This was Hepburn√¢??s chance to shine and boy does this breakout role do just that, as well as define her as the epitome of a modern woman. Her character√¢??s power over her position was integral in giving her this image of a liberated woman with an unconventional lifestyle, something she maintained in real life by dating a married Spencer Tracy for 26 years, making her portrayal as Tracy Lord utterly believable. Having three men lust over her in The Philadelphia Story breaks all barriers faced by females, and exemplifies the importance of Hepburn√¢??s persona in allowing her character to blossom into a vehicle for change. Lord√¢??s constant wailing and exaggerated actions make her an instantly powerful character that thrives massively under the drooling of her male co-stars who it seems are entranced by Hepburn√¢??s all-eyes-on-me performance. But no one can forget the men trying to win her affection as Stewart√¢??s immature lusting over Hepburn produces that explosiveness of a short-term romance, whilst Grant√¢??s calm and caring fa√É¬ßade emblazons him as the lover Hepburn desires, but cannot have. The Philadelphia Story is a comedy of remarriage due to the production code of the time, therefore Hepburn√¢??s character had to divorce first, then be allowed to flirt, and then she can get back with her ex-husband without breaking any rules of adultery. This ingenious way of working around the censors of its time demonstrates why romantic tales of the past will always be better than those of today because the fact that it can√¢??t just show what it wants, it has to work to find a way, develops the story in a unique way, and allows for plenty of candid moments. Hepburn√¢??s drunken night with Stewart typifies why The Philadelphia Story remains a rare portrayal of affection. Along with It Happened One Night, this film proves that the simpler the romantic tale, the more believable the romance will be which in turn elevates our love for the characters and our connection to their vocation. The Philadelphia Story is so straightforward it is bland, but the manner in which Hepburn and her male co-stars joust for affection has seriously made The Philadelphia Story a rollercoaster of a love-square that never ceases in its pursuit of love.
 
The Verdict:
 
Katharine Hepburn√¢??s empowered nature allows her to stampede her way through men and love, as well as, along with her male co-stars Cary Grant and James Stewart, produce a romantic comedy in The Philadelphia Story that ranks as one of the best.

2,"I like classic films, particularly classic comedies because I have a strong affection for wit over the crass nonsense that passes for modern comedy.  I love Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart, so a 40s comedy starring those two should be a big win for me.  Yet I was sadly disappointed.  One of the issues I had with the film was Katharine Hepburn.  While I certainly don't think she is a bad actress, I wasn't even slightly convinced that she felt genuine affection for any of the men in this film.  There was no chemistry at all in those relationships.  Therefore I wasn't interested in how she would decide because I didn't know if she even cared.  That doesn't matter in some films, but I feel like this was intended as an early example of a romantic comedy, so selling the romance is extremely essential to the story.

But even romantic relationships without chemistry can still interest me if there is a good story or a lot of laughs.  The real difficulty I had with this film was the fact that the dialogue was way too rapid-fire.  I struggled to follow half of what was said, and even rewound some scenes just to make sure I was able to understand what was going on.  Any humor that might have been included in the dialogue was lost on me because I didn't have time to react to it before 3 more lines had been delivered.  I'm all for quick-witted humor, but The Philadelphia Story takes that term way too literal.  There are a few sweet moments, and I might have chuckled once or twice, but this is a movie that fell drastically short of my expectations.  Perhaps if I were willing to watch it more times I would follow the story better and get the subtle nuances, but there weren't enough positives to make me want to give this movie another chance.",The Philadelphia Story

The long scenes and simplicity of the sets make it easy to see that this is an adaptation of a stage play, but I think that format works well for this story.

2,"PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST

""I'm going crazy. I'm standing here solidly on my own two hands and I'm going crazy.""

Ever since I got into classic cinema, there's always one particular film that's been calling my name for some time, and that's The Philadelphia Story, a romantic comedy directed by George Cukor and starring some of the finest classic Hollywood stars in the history of film, Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart. It's also regarded by many classic movie buffs as one of the greatest comedies ever made, with an 100% score on the Tomatometer and is ranked as the #51 movie of all-time according to the American Film Institute. With all this praise, you'd think that I would also really enjoy the film right? After my two-hour experience, I'm sorry to say that The Philadelphia Story was not worth its hype.

Meet Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn), a spoiled rich woman who's about to be married to George Kittridge (John Howard). CK Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), the guy who was once married to Tracy and still sore over the breakup, calls upon Spy Magazine reporter Macaulay Conner (Jimmy Stewart) and photographer Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) to crash the wedding, which starts to backfire when both Dexter and Macaulay start to fall for Tracy's charms.

With all the acclaim the film has, you're probably wondering why I didn't care for the film too much? Well, for a 1940's comedy, it's quite dated. Most of the humor which is filled with witty remarks and punchlines that I should have really cracked up on just didn't fly, and I was mostly bored with the final result. I only laughed out loud at least twice in the movie, one being the opening scene where Cary Grant is kicked out of his own home (which I'm surprised got passed the Hay's Code as it features him knocking Katherine Hepburn to the floor, which was actually very hilarious) and the other time when I realized how overrated this film is. I knew the film was going to be annoying when I heard this so-called funny joke (""If you're not Papa then that makes you...""   ""Available."").What also disappointed me was that the film wasn't really a comedy, it felt more like a romantic drama or something like that, and that's what makes the film so... boring. The situations the characters get into aren't really that memorable or entertaining and we're left with a very dull screenplay and a very boring movie. Even the film score by Franz Waxman, one of the best composers in that era, was not even remotely catchy in any way. I just don't get the acclaim of this film.

If there's one word I have to give on Cary Grant's performance, then bland would be that word. As much as I like Cary Grant, I didn't feel the connection here. You don't care for his character, you don't get a good reason why he still cares for the woman he's trying to wreck, and his chemistry with Hepburn is weak, which shocks me cause they did a fantastic job together in Bringing Up Baby, which had a much funnier script and more engaging humor than this had. Don't get me wrong, I think Cary Grant is a great actor, but I was not impressed with his role here.

As for Jimmy Stewart, who I rank in my Top 5 actors of all-time, considering the not-so memorable screenplay given, he actually does a good job in what he's given, especially his chemistry with Hepburn (which was decent compared to Grant's wooden performance), though there are some moments in the film where he kind of overdoes it, such as a scene where he wants to make out with Hepburn drunk (a scene that doesn't work due to the Hay's Code restrictions, I might add). Stewart won an Oscar for his performance, something that he believed that the Academy was making up for on account of him not winning the Oscar for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. I believe Stewart is correct on that statement; Mr. Smith was a very compelling role to handle, especially for an actor as young as Stewart was when he did the film. His performance here was definitely not Oscar-worthy. Henry Fonda should have won for The Grapes of Wrath instead.

Katherine Hepburn meanwhile, is the most complicated actress to talk about, especially for The Philadelphia Story. Before the film's release, she was labeled ""box-office poison"" after the failure of Bringing Up Baby (which she was blamed for) and was kicked out of Hollywood, forced to do her acting on Broadway. After the success of the Broadway version of The Philadelphia Story, Hepburn thought it was a good idea to make into a movie, and with the film's success, Hepburn's career skyrocketed again, up to the point where the AFI regards her as the greatest actress of all-time. While I honestly did not care for the film, I give Hepburn credit for gaining a comeback with this film, and I was actually impressed with her performance. While the humor was dated and the situations were not that memorable, Hepburn still managed to grab my attention, despite the fact that she has poor chemistry with Cary Grant. I liked the fact that though her character's supposed to be spoiled, she doesn't go super obnoxious in the role, rather having a more independent nature in what her character is going through. I strongly believe that if anyone deserved to win an Oscar for a film that I would call rotten, Hepburn should have been the one to have won it, not Jimmy Stewart.

I can see why the film was regarded as a classic back in 1940, but I could care less about The Philadelphia Story. Despite the good performances of both Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart, the humor doesn't hold up in today's standards, the so-called hilarious situations are not memorable, there's parts of the story that feel one-dimensional (such as Cary Grant's motivations), and Cary Grant gives one of the most dull, bland performances in a 1940's film that I've seen. When I watched It Happened One Night, I described it as ""the most overrated comedy that I've ever seen"". After watching The Philadelphia Story, I now believe that it's the most overrated comedy that I've ever seen. Funniest part is that the film's remake, a musicalized version called High Society, starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelley, and Frank Sinatra, even with the same situations and mostly the same dialogue, was a lot more memorable and a lot more fun, and one that I would call a real, essential classic. I did not get that when watching The Philadelphia Story.

3,"After waiting all these years to finally view it, I have to say, I most certainly wanted to love TPS.  It's a cinema classic.  It filled to the brim with legendary stars.  It was rewarded by Oscar. ...but I didn't love it at all.  Actually, I only kind of liked it.  I can see the groundwork for romantic comedy.  There were certainly moments of brilliance (especially in some of Stewart's scenes).  Cary Grant was dreamily swoonworthy (the original Don Draper of smooth).  Young Virginia Weidler stole scenes. Yet, it just seemed a little... dare I say, dull.  IDK.  3 stars",The Philadelphia Story

5,"This is comedy at its brilliant best and remains one of the best examples of a couple who decide to divorce, flirt with others, and then decide to remarry. The opening scene of the movie is so funny you should get into it immediately. The film also gave Katharine Hepburn her first hit since a string of flops, and this film showed that she could do absolutely anything in film. James Stewart won an Oscar for his role as Macaulay Connor, a reporter who wants to get every detail of the wedding possible. Ruth Hussey (who was nominated for Supporting Actress) plays the photographer also desperate to get into the act. Cary Grant gives a nice performance as Dexter, while the screenplay, written by Donald Ogden Stewart, won the film's second Oscar. It was later remade in 1956 with the musical High Society. No matter how many years ago this was released, it will always remain a classic and is my personal favourite film of 1940.",The Philadelphia Story

A wonderfully acting film from all three actors, Katherine Hepburn, James Stewart, and Cary Grant. Stewart won the oscar as best actor for his role as Macaulay Connor. I believe that both Grant and Stewart did such a fine job that either one could have switch roles and both would have done a fabulous job.  Funny, how Cary Grant was offered the role of Conner but instead went for the ex, C.K. Dexter Haven, and James Stewart won the oscar. As I said though, I think it wouldn't have mattered who played who they both would've pulled it off. And that tells you how good they are as actors. Ok, back to the film. This film is delightful from start to finish. The acting, directing, and writing makes this film one of the best of all times.

4,"I have three favourite screwball comedies of this era, all featuring Grant, and two featuring Hepburn. The Philadelphia Story is my least favourite of the three, because it's a fair bit less absurd and comedic (the other two are His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby). But that doesn't mean The Philadelphia Story isn't awesome in it's own right. In many ways it's not typical screwball comedy at all - sure it has it's fair share of farce, but this film is deeper, richer and more complex than most of its ilk. It's also a lot crueler and heartrending - mainly thanks to Katie H's incredible perf as Tracy Lord - not many characters in 2 hour films get given some complexity, and I can't think of another actress (then or now) that could've nailed the role of the wounded, yearning socialite so well. She's matched by Stewart here, playing a more cynical role than usual, and he delivers the funniest scene in the piece - his drunken bit opposite Cray Grant is beautifully, hilariously observed. Speaking of CG, HE'S different from usual too, less of the manic panic in his earlier roles, less of the narcoleptic urbanity of his later ones - here he underplays perfectly as one of the realest characters I've seen him observe, a person (like his ex-wife) burdened with past mistakes, grasping for the chance to maybe make up for some of them. Damn, that all sounds really heavy. This film IS a comedy - a fleet-footed, fast-moving, spolit-society-of-manners, stage-play-type comedy. It's just a very interesting comedy. And it's very, very yar.",The Philadelphia Story

This movie had no lavish sets, locale or wardrobe, no death-defying stunts or massive pyrotechnics and a serious lack of computer-generated anything. All  you have is an ensemble of fast-talking, incredibly talented actors paired with a witty, equally clever writing and a very silly, yet all too probably but simple situation; and, what you get is a perfectly madcap and utterly entertaining film! It's so unfortunate, that Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore (and I seriously doubt they could ever recapture this bygone cinematic magic) because they are just so wonderful. The talent was so different back then, there's just this aura of sophistication that sorely lacking with the crop of ""celebrities"" now-a-days, and the quality of the humor was so high-brow, relying more on lightning-quick, whimsical quips, perfectly timed banter and double entendre rather than on juvenile, sophomoric fart (or other bodily function) jokes.

For some reason the people who lived through the Great Depression liked to watch movies that made fun of the rich and powerful.  Katharine Hepburn played the female lead in both the movie and stage play.  She was still young and good looking in this movie.  There is a couple of scenes and dialog that would be considered politically incorrect today.  Before World War II the rich were expected to play a role and to engage in activities that were expected of the ""rich"".  The setting of the movie is this world of old money ultra rich.

There's brilliant chemistry between them and the rest of the cast. Rich Philadelphia socialite Tracy Samantha Lord (Katharine Hepburn) divorced her husband C. K.

It's a well made film, it has the hallmarks of a screwball comedy, but it's a lot more classy to be one, and it has a nice romantic feel to it.

<i>Philadelphia Story</i> is a hilarious comedy, starring Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and James Stewart. With that cast, along with a great script and inspired direction, make this movie a treat to watch.
The three stars are obviously the Story at work here, but minor characters also play an influential part.  To the extent in  which the older adult members of Hepburn's family have no clue as to what is transpiring, while the child clearly does, is most amusing. It ought to be said that <i>Philadelphia Story</i> is far from all that humourous. The sense of humour is more of the clever and fleeting kind of variation. Most of it arises either from Grant's splendid persona, with his wry, charismatic tones, or Hepburn's flighty, beguiling, enchanting mannerisms. I would say that Grant is to a degree under used in his role, as there are very large stretches of the picture where he is not on screen. Stewart is however excellent, playing a sensitive, artistic type who understandably is somewhat taken by Hepburn's Tracy Lord. All three stars are much in their element and they bask in it's glory, with accents as remembered by all, and a fitting social setting.

As has been said by some other film scribe, <i>""a strong case is being made as to the sheer irresistibility of the film's female star""</i>. Katharine Hepburn is shown at her most statuesque and in a beautiful disposition. Her character has an impressive array of fine lines to deliver also, and is treated with dignity and understanding by the effective script. It is in some ways a voyage of self discovery for Hepburn's Miss Lord.  Ranging from a rejection of her anointed <i>goddess</i> status, a rejection of marriage for mere hierarchical gain and a deeper understanding of the meaning of love.

The film's about-face ending is quite charming really, mixing the conservative with the progressive. Conservative in that marriage is seen to have to take place, and in the characters returning to earlier relationships. It could indeed be argued that not enough had been made of Stewart's relations with Ruth Hussey's character. Progressive it could be said, in that events have been very quickly turned upside down, and love over society is championed. Also, perhaps most tellingly, the drunken indiscretion of Hepburn is not just forgiven, but seen as part of her self-discovery. This film in its treatment of a liberated woman such as Hepburn, must be praised for its sensitivity and liberal understanding. All too often, Hollywood allowed the reactionary and the puritanically conservative to lazily dominate its films. 

We are presented with an upper-middle class milieu, with contrasts provided by Grant's hard-bitten aristocratic dandy and John Howard's dullard <i>""man of the people""</i> politician. There is nothing staggering about the film's assertion that the upper classes can be perfectly charming and noble, whilst those of the lower classes, like Howard, can be lacking charm and appear materialistic. It seems merely to be making a point of its very balance, and is almost a fig leaf to those who would have expected a simplistic socialist line.

Need it be mentioned that Cukor's direction is excellent? Making an art form of the unobtrusive, he lets the camera just take in the performances and the script, without distraction. He captures Hepburn in a radiant and sensitive light that I suppose slightly overshadows the male leads. There are artistic shots at times, that evoke occasional counterpoint to the usual images of the starts. One lingering shot of the precocious child watching from out of her window the night's events, is a good example of this working to great effect. An effect of establishing a wider, but still near-motionless canvass to the story.

<i>Philadelphia Story</i> is cleverly and entertainingly written, and delightfully well acted by all involved. It's hard to imagine anyone finding it dull or beneath them, but apparently some people can find anything beneath them. Indeed their defeat. If you haven't seen this, please do. If you haven't seen it in a while, give it another viewing. You won't be disappointed. It's standards and assumptions are a bit dated, but the humour, wit, and heart are certainly not.",The Philadelphia Story

3,"You won't see many romantic comedies better than George Cukor's ""The Philadelphia Story."" More than anything else it heavily relies on a very well written screenplay with such cunningly satirical dialogues, and of course the greatness of Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and James Stewart. Not to mention the fine performances of the supporting cast, I laughed out loud in several sequences, particularly in the beginning. At times the language was difficult to follow, which isn't a negative, just an excuse to see this film again and appreciate Donald Ogden Stewart's witty script. I've seen Hepburn and Grant in ""Bringing Up Baby,"" I have to say ""The Philadelphia Story"" is a notch better, maybe I even love it more than another classic in ""It Happened One Night."" 

Since I am most familiar with James Stewart...

What can you say about Jimmy Stewart? He is one of the greatest actors of any era with one of the most impressive resumes ever! There is the underrated ""Harvey,"" about a man who has an invisible rabbit as a friend. His collaborations with Frank Capra in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are some of the best films of that time. And, of course there is John Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" along with Alfred Hitchcock in ""Rope,"" ""Rear Window,"" and most significantly in ""Vertigo.""

4,"[A/95] A scintillating, arch romantic comedy that shines through a brilliant, fencing screenplay and irresistible star power of the highest caliber. This is a very talky (almost cerebral) piece of humorous theatre, much in the line of a Shakespearean or Wildean comedy of manners, with its witty surface quippings on social classes, its whiff of scandal, farcical human pretense, and players pretending to be (and sometimes turning into) people they are not. Also, as with much of the classic plays, beneath all the silly goings-on and momentary chaos operates a deceptively subtle (and, in this case, awesomely relaxed) matrix of personal needs and expectations that center everything in the ever-relevant romantic realm of finding or re-finding love.

With a memorable and talented cast and supporting cast, who illuminate the scenes they occupy with a rare, fascinating quality and control (and unpredictability). Cary Grant, with a remarkably gentle internal portrayal of the reformed boozer ex-husband with mysterious motivations; James Stewart as the conflicted, somewhat foolish, but sensitive writer-reporter; and Katherine Hepburn, as the cool, haughty, statuesque aristocratic daughter whose powers and personality drive the story into a kind of midsummer's night renegotiation and revaluation of emotions, all are at the tops of their games here, and wonderful to behold.

And I love how raunchy and unrestrained a lot of the humor was back then, it's not how it is nowadays where most things can be offensive. You could actually learn to laugh at yourself and laugh at the world instead of being afraid of it. That footage of Willowbrook Institute was shocking. It was like something out of a horror movie. The conditions that those kids were living in was both heartbreaking, terrifying and sad. 

A really insightful and eye-opening documentary on the history of Camp Jened and the struggles but also great achievements and accomplishments of the disabled community. It shed some light on the disabled civil rights movement that was never talked about, I didn't even know that happened. It's also really inspiring seeing the change that Judy and all the disabled community behind her were able to establish for disabled people all around the world.

Having worked in Easter Seal and private camps for the disabled in my youth, similarly situated in rural New Jersey, the camp scenes were bittersweet reminders of the people we lived and worked with and the often incandescent optimism they radiated under heartbreaking circumstances. I also worked for a short time in state run 'hospital' for the disabled, a less uplifting experience. The continuing story of rights for the disabled reminds us of the way things used to be in the (not so) ""good old days"", how far we have come as a society, and how far there is still left to go.",Crip Camp

But the most intriguing point of this documentary was the positive public and political changes that it led to. I think the documentary could've benefited from a better focus on ""why"" this story is important--the events around the coming societal changes or the need for more camps (or something similar to camps). Maybe also better psychological understanding of their repression so the antics of the camp make sense to the average viewer. Overall, it's an important story unapologetically told with some charming moments. But something is missing in it for me that would tie it all together with a nicer packaging.

3,"When the 1960s civil rights movement got into high gear, one constituency seeking equality felt left out -- disabled Americans. But they were not to be denied, and they began finding their voice through a summer camp in the Catskills designed to enable them to experience the feelings of mainstream living. Drawing upon their time here, they would later adapt the lessons learned to push for the equal rights that would eventually become embodied in the Americans with Disabilities Act, an initiative that would go on to have implications internationally. Through a wealth of archive footage and interviews with camp residents and counselors (many of whom were hippies and minorities, themselves seekers of reform and equal rights), directors James Lebrecht and Nicole Newnham tell this little-known story in a revealing and often quite surprising documentary, filled with an array of moments ranging from touching to heartbreaking to inspiring and even hilarious. However, for all its strengths, the film is not without its shortcomings, such as not enough linkage between camp life experience and the legacy it inspired, as well as some less-than-ideal selections of archive footage that seem more incidental than enlightening, material that could have easily been cut. Still, it's indeed captivating to see what can emerge out of humble (and seemingly unrelated) beginnings and the tremendous impact they can have, perhaps the film's greatest asset of all.",Crip Camp

4,"This film could have easily been preachy, or tone deaf, but was able to completely skirt that and become a great film filled with humanity, connection, and even some humor. It was extremely interesting how a pre-ADA/504 world affected these young people, and what drove them to their protests that solidified them as voices in 60s civil rights, and the ongoing fight for social and societal equitable civil liberties. A small unexpected highlight of this film is how the subjects of the movie are shown as romantic, sexual beings, among the rest of the complexity of who these people are. This is just something that seems to be omitted from the little bit of other media that actually does feature differently abled people. I'm hoping this film is just the start of more, well portrayed stories of differently abled people.",Crip Camp
3,"Out almost a year ago now, this uplifting documentary made by the Obamas' production company about the fight for Disability Rights has unsurprisingly been nominated for an Oscar this year. James Lebrecht, one of the co-director and co-writer of the project has spina bifida and has been confined to a wheelchair since birth. Yet he manages to overcome his disability to have a normal family life and a career as a sound engineer. From his personal experience and that of people he met in 1971 at Camp Jened, a summer camp that caters especially for young disabled people, the film threads out a not particularly well known section in US history where the struggle for Disability Rights took place side-by-side next to the fight for racial equalities and gay rights in the same era. It's a more straightforward documentary that fuses humour with poignancy through archival footage taken at the Camp and media coverage of the 504 Protest in San Francisco, coupled with interviews of the major players who took part, many of whom I'm happy to see are living their full lives in their senior years. The film is both a valuable history lesson and an education of the realities people with disabilities have to face everyday in relation to basic freedoms like sex and privacy that the rest of us take for granted; and it's great that this illuminating film is able to give these people representation and documents their fight to have their voice heard.",Crip Camp

The first 45 minutes or so about the camp itself I found fasicnating watch, which said much that resonates  - not least the power of enabling people to be around those who have similar journeys to themselves. This can result in all sorts of things, and the documentary gives a good and moving airing to this. The rest of the film - around an hour - is the story of the political activism, lobbying hard for changes to laws and the enacting of laws to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of disability..

5,"Beginning in the early 1950s, Camp Jened, in upstate New York, was a place where teenagers with disabilities could go and experience, many for the first time, a place where they could be teenagers and live freely with people like them with disabilities. In the late '60s and early '70s, the camp was run by hippies, so there were a lot of freedoms provided that the kids did not get elsewhere. Many of these summer campers ended up migrating to the Center for Independent Living in Berkeley, an innovative center focused on providing services to the disabled. It was here that the movement for passage of the Rehabilitation Act (particularly Section 504) and the Americans with Disabilities act began.  This is a wonderful film that details the path toward the passage of Section 504 and the ADA Act. Fortunately for us, a local theater troupe spent significant time filming the kids; there is a lot of archival footage that is just such a joy to watch ‚Äì they are being kids, they are funny, and they all talk about being in a place that values them for who they are. The way many of these kids, later as adults, and with the support of many organizations, mobilized to create change is inspiring. Several of those kids are still alive today, and the film contains a lot of interview footage as these older adults look back on their times in the movement and in Camp Jened. Huge thumbs up from me! I absolutely loved this film that is an important and poignant slice of history; it is a film everyone should see.

2,"Loved the first 25-30% --which is the only part about ""crip camp"" -- has marvelous footage of this special and interesting camp with a free-spirited 1970s ethos and gave people who were differently abled the opportunity to experience freedom and be unwatched, to just BE and find out who they were and what they were capable, away from their families and schools, and amongst others with whom they had a lot in common. I was waiting for that part of the film to go a lot deeper, but instead it shifted trajectories and is 75-80% is about the Americans with Disabilities Act and the founding and formation of the disability rights movements--all of which is absolutely important, but turgid in the telling, and not what I signed on for.  It felt more a linear recitation and brag sheet of chronological events, challenges, triumphs, etc. Not that that's unwarranted, per se--and that history deserves to be chronicled and those stories told and remembered--but it was not tremendously engaging, and felt a chore to watch it. I ""get"" that the 2 parts are connected because many of the leaders in the disability rights movement all went to ""crip camp,"" but the emphasis was on the disability rights movement rather than more complexity and depth explored---ambiguities and ambivalences, pros and cons, more of the beauty, how the camp came to fail, who were its critics, who believed in it, what was it--other than simply attending this camp--that might have contributed to some of these people (all of whom are from NY) ending up as political leaders and community activists, largely in California.  The end when 2 people revisit the site the camp used to be on felt rushed, and tacked on. But I applaud the filmmakers for their effort.

3,"March 27, 2020

Perhaps the main title, ""Crip Camp,"" and the poster for it, which features a disabled kid in a wheelchair being pushed around by a guitar-holding camp counselor, are misleading. Because even though this spirits-raising documentary does, indeed, tell us about Camp Jened, a sublime retreat nestled in New York's Catskills that served as a sanctuary for kids with special needs‚Äîand even begins with its still living campers recollecting how this heavenly place made them feel normal, included and empowered‚Äîthe film as a whole is about so much more than the camp. 

It's a good thing the film has a more fitting subtitle: ""A Disability Revolution."" In many ways, this is an epic, one that spans four decades, and suggests Camp Jened, and other places like it, played a pivotal role in lighting the fuse for members of the disabled community to see themselves as people‚Äîpeople who mattered‚Äîand were therefore entitled to the same basic privileges as everyone else. Following their time at Jened, many turned to activism to guarantee the kinds of civil rights and amenities that non-disabled people often take for granted.

About the camp, director James LeBrecht, himself a disabled man and former camper, says, ""[it] changed the world, and nobody knows this story."" In a rather traditional and straightforward manner, LeBrecht and co-director Nicole Newnham set out to reveal Camp Jened's legacy and the result is entertaining, informative and heartwarming, although not exactly risky.

While the history behind Camp Jened is inherently interesting, what keeps ""Crip Camp"" as a whole moving is the way it constantly adds layers to its narrative, starting off simple and evolving into something deeper and farther-reaching than a just a trip down memory lane for its handicapped subjects. 

When we first meet LeBrecht, it's in footage from an old newscast that shows how he was physically able to perform his job as a sound designer at the Berkeley Repertory Theater while living with spina bifida, a birth defect that rendered his legs immobile. When he was 15, he spent his first summer at Jened, a camp ""run by hippies"" that fostered activities like sports, singing, filmmaking (it was here where LeBrecht got his first taste of videography), swimming, and yes, even sex and romance.

All this was done in an effort by the camp's founder, Larry Allison, to make its participants not feel marginalized, a concept that was mostly abstract to them. And you know what? It worked. As we watch old video footage taken at the camp, which has since closed, we get the sense the kids' summers here were the first time they felt like they were calling the shots, making such seemingly trivial decisions as what they should all make for dinner the one night they knew the camp's cooks would be taking the night off. Judy Heumann, who contracted polio at 18 months, projects her voice to a crowd and asks, ""How many want lasagna?""

As it turns out, this would mark the beginning of Judy's role as a passionate leader, and from this point on, ""Crip Camp"" transitions from light reflection on a small group of young people's formative years to an all-encompassing, cultural history lesson. The film focuses a lot on Heumann, which is appropriate since her story is not only impressive but also extends to so many others from the disabled community. 

Among other things, Heumann became the first teacher in New York City to use a wheelchair after she sued the Board of Education for discrimination on the basis she was physically handicapped. She also co-founded Disabled In Action, an organization that, to this day, seeks to protect the civil rights of people with disabilities. And perhaps her most notable accomplishment was spearheading the 26-day 504 Sit-in in San Francisco, during which over 100 hundred protestors occupied the Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) office and demanded the regulations set forth by the Rehabilitation Act, as they apply to the handicapped, actually be enforced.

Learning about these accomplishments, we get the sense all of Heumann's pursuits were part of her lifelong mission to not be viewed as ""sick,"" but simply disabled, and that non-disabled people need only see her as someone who happens to be sitting in a chair, not as someone to fear or as someone who's weak. In fact, she's just the opposite‚ÄîHeumann is uncommonly bold, intelligent and outspoken. And even though many of her endeavors, including the 504 Sit-in, were a success, she never became complacent. She didn't think she should have to feel grateful for basic services such as access to a public bathroom. Her persistence, along with so many others', eventually led to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which, despite being a landmark law, still isn't perfect.

While the historical events presented in ""Crip Camp"" are stirring, LeBrecht and Newnham luckily break up the protest footage and news stories with personal asides that help them accomplish what they set out to do, which is to demystify and humanize the handicapped. One such moment involves Denise Sherer Jacobson, who has cerebral palsy, reminiscing about losing her virginity and earning a degree in human sexuality. She's funny and candid about her past and the scenes she shares with her polio-stricken husband, Neil, are sweet and romantic. They remind us that, yes, even handicapped people have sex drives and yearn to fall in love.

Other scenes are more heartbreaking yet redemptive, including when journalist HolLynn D'Lil recalls how she became a paraplegic at 22 after a truck ran her off the road. ""I had all the assumptions and prejudices that people have about people with disabilities‚Ä¶and suddenly I was one."" She would go on to write a memoir about the 504 Sit-in and it's perhaps through D'Lil's story that we're able to gain the most insight and empathy toward the handicapped because we realize the potential loss of control over one's body doesn't discriminate and can affect anyone at any time, and if this is the case, shouldn't we all make sure we're prepared and that everybody is taken care of?

I suggested the film is rather safe in its approach. Structurally, ""Crip Camp"" is a by-the-numbers documentary, with the usual talking heads, archival footage, interstitials that give us additional information and updates, etc. This is adequate, but I wish LeBrecht and Newnham had tried to make it more experimental from a filmmaking point of view. Something about the presentation just feels too standard and basic.

The movie also features an overly familiar soundtrack, and even though songs like ""For What It's Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield, ""Crimson and Clover"" by Tommy James & The Shondells, and ""Volunteers"" by Jefferson Airplane are classics and fine for capturing the cultural zeitgeist, they've been used so many times in popular culture that I sometimes felt I was watching an episode of ""The Wonder Years"" or ""Forrest Gump,"" which was actually distracting. I get that the filmmakers wanted to make their movie as accessible and digestible as possible, but there are other, less recognizable songs from its eras they could have leveraged.  

Still, the movie achieves its goal. I walked away from it enlightened, inspired, and informed about an aspect of the civil rights movement that rarely, if ever, gets the attention it deserves. Hopefully ""Crip Camp"" will start a trend that will encourage other storytellers to bring to light lesser known histories so that we all might learn from them. However, it's going to take a lot more than a well-intentioned documentary to change people's behaviors and methods of thinking. To be honest, even after watching a film as important and eye-opening as ""Crip Camp,"" I know I'm not going to all of a sudden question or be mindful if something I take for granted is also equipped for others. ""Crip Camp"" helps, but it's an active, lifelong practice to see others as people equal to yourself, something the Jim LeBrechts and Judy Heumanns of the world know better than most.",Crip Camp
5,"A story I never had heard. Eye-opening, heart-piercing, engaging. The cinematography, story, soundtrack were all perfection, and it is impossible to finish that movie with profound respect and awe of the strength of the individuals who advocated for 504 and ADA.

5,"Really lovely documentary that was a joy to watch. This checks the boxes of uplifting, inspiring, intimate, and educational for me. This is very much a feel good documentary, but heed the rating - it has a lot of sex and drugs and naughty language, if your kids are under the age of the kids in the camp it's probably too mature for them to watch too!

I wouldn't call it ""riveting"", but it's not that kind of documentary. You really get to know these people and feel for their struggle. It's heartfelt and lovely, and in the end they follow-up on how everybody is doing today (IMO a must have in a documentary like this that looks at events in the relatively near past). I would encourage anybody and everybody to watch this, especially if you're not disabled. I feel like I learned a lot and it's made me a better person.

As far as composition, this documentary lays out events in a clean chronological fashion that's easy to follow and remember details. It's thorough and well edited - the people it chose to follow are ones you keep meeting as they grow up and as it transitions from the camp to the civil rights movement. Overall the effect adds emotion to the civil rights movement - these aren't just revolutionaries, they're the kids that had the summer of their lives 20 minutes ago.",Crip Camp
5,Excellent and moving documentary.,Crip Camp
4,"Raised with a premise of terror, it is a masterclass on how to make cinema at close range, realistic and pure, letting the luminous nooks and crannies pass by while enveloping the viewer in an absorbing feeling of crisis and the need for hope. It is also a sample of art as human reflection of a specific moment, a brutal time capsule.",76 Days
1,"Given the very generous reviews to date, I had high expectations for this documentary. There was nothing special or insightful about it. It goes without saying that only the highest level of government approval would have permitted this access at this critical time so it seems a little over rehearsed. I also felt the filming was excessively close to the subjects which may have been an attempt to act as a constant reminder they were being filmed. If you have ever been filmed for extended periods of time, you know it's very easy to actually forget you're being recorded. I wanted to like it but was disappointed in the end.",76 Days
3,"an emotional, genuine, reflective story",76 Days
5,"The first 10 seconds of this documentary will grip you. This will dispel all notions of COVID-19 not being a serious disease with gut-wrenching consequences for people all over the world. Although this was short listed for an Oscar, I was disappointed to see that it didn't get to the nomination stage.

Of course, what's even more saddening is all the people who will call this propaganda at the expense of those who have died. The humanity of frontline health care workers is demonstrated in picture perfect composition as one of the co-directors was actually a still photographer.

Must watch!",76 Days

4,"76 Days offers an interesting look into the Chinese healthcare system and shows some excellent footage of how medical professionals have been dealing with the influx of coronavirus patients during the pandemic. It's great to have this footage as a historical record to look back at, but it's unfortunate that there wasn't more context for many of the scenes. Things jumped around a bit too much without enough information to fully follow along. The documentary also played it very safe when it came to showing China's response, which meant that the full story was not on display, although you can argue that that's fine since the focus was on the hospitals. Finally, the cinematography was top notch. Godspeed doctors and nurses.",76 Days
4,"76 Days is a documentary that takes a look at the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the hospitals of Wuhan. The movie is lacking in terms of geopolitics and science, but its apolitical and fly-on-the-wall approach led to a meticulously detailed, horrific, but ultimately surprisingly humanistic look into these hospitals and how they operated. It's an eerie, but also tender film about this pivotal moment in recent human history.",76 Days
4,"Perhaps too harsh and difficult to watch in 2020, but definitely touching and emotional. The makers captured with such sensibility, respect, and care the essence of these people giving everything they've got to save these other people, like on a battlefield. Proof there's still hope and good out there, despite the desperation, uncertainty, and trauma this ""thing"" has brought to us all.",76 Days

5,"Moving, outstanding gut-punch of a film..... 
Wonderful acting to a cracking script adds to a helluva directing debut from Carla Simon.",Summer 1993
4,"Carla Sim√≥n's debut film is wise, not only in cinematographic terms but in her understanding of the human being, specially - and more complicated- of childhood. Accompanied by her surprising child interpreters, the director immerses us in the story of Frida, a girl who lost her parents to AIDS and who is full of questions, sadness and, of course, anger. What makes this film transcendent despite its simplicity is the subtlety with which the director tells the story, without the need for clich√©s and unnecessary resources, wasted by use, such as sad music or incessant tearing, shows that based on of small details and very strong feelings it is possible to innovate in the coming-of-age. What I like the most is that the director is smart enough to know that children are not innocent and can plan, manipulate and take revenge, although she does not judge her little protagonist for it.",Summer 1993
5,"I felt I was not watching a movie. I was watching a summer in some people's real life. It reminded me of what it was to be a child and be confused, sad and angry, and to lose a loved one to death at that age. It also felt very familiar to me because I left my hometown, which is in Spain, at 5 years old. The ending really touched me. The crying was inevitable.",Summer 1993
4,"'Estiu 1993' is an exquisite film: not just because of its superb acting, its lovely ambience, or its brilliant shots; its beauty lies at the way it explores the feelings of a child - that of jealousy, shame, sadness, confusion, enthusiasm and more. It does not treat the child as an immature human, as unimportant, as a simple-to-understand doll. No, 'Estiu 1993' explores - perhaps not fully, but this might be impossible - the children's feelings in a rarely-seen respectful and earnest way.",Summer 1993

2,"One of the major advantages of having a theatre like The Classic Gateway Theatre is that you get to see most of the independent films and will come across a stunner now and then but that is not the case with ""Summer 1993"". Based on the true story of the director and screenwriter of the movie Carla Simon we follow 6-year-old Frida (Laia Artigas), upon the death of her mother and father, sent to live with her mother's brother Esteve (David Verdaguer), his wife Marga (Bruni Cusi) and their 3-year-old child Anna (Paula Robles).

We watch Frida as she adjusts, or doesn't, to her new life and how her new family adjusts or doesn't, to this addition into their home. Unable to understand or vocalize her pain Frida lashes out in awkward, sometimes dangerous and, other times, bewildering ways.

I missed an important factor in the movie which is primarily explained in the title and the last 2-3 minutes of the film which became obvious about a few incidents that take place in the movie. I don't usually give spoilers in film reviews and I won't here but I am more surprised that I didn't catch on to this.

In spite of that disclosure, I didn't find ""Summer 1993"" interesting enough to recommend it though Laia Artigas as Frida gives a natural performance and you can feel what she doesn't seem to be able to express.",Summer 1993
4,"A lot of times I thought I knew where the movie was going and I was wrong, and most of the time I was glad. It‚Äôs not predictable and for that reason it held my attention. Bittersweet. The ending caught me off guard and had me in tears, so much that I had to compose myself before leaving the theater. Wonderful cast all around. The two little girls are absolutely adorable.",Summer 1993

4,"Spurred by one of the best child performances ever by Laia Artigas (Frida), 'Summer 1993' in a fantastic initial feature film from Carla Simon.

Paula Robles (Anna), who can't be older than four, is also spectacular.  These two children, coupled with a powerful story make for a rewarding movie that takes its time to fire.  Simon gets the emotion of the children in a fashion rarely seen on the big screen.  This is great.  Nearly forgot to mention this was a date night film with the wife.  It's a double recommend!  Wife: 8.8/Husband: 9.4 Average Final Score: 9.1/10",Summer 1993
4,"As I write this review I am still losing water from my eyes straight on the keyboard, so the first thing I want to say is: watch at your own risk! The story is both very simple and very complex, and the viewer can experience it through the eyes of the little protagonist. The fact that these images are the real memories of a young director, makes them even more poignant.
Watch it, and live it. It is a powerful, gorgeous and sad experience.",Summer 1993

Not necessarily in ways that were inappropriate for the audience but the screenplay does take a lot of narrative risks that mostly pay off (i.e. Buzz Lightyear's delusion regarding his identity that gets shattered, Woody's fear of being replaced that manifests in violence, everything with Sid).

4,"""Toy Story, an iconic cinematic masterpiece, undoubtedly warrants the acclaim it has received over the years. With an impeccable 100% rating from critics, it firmly holds its place as a paramount achievement in the world of film. For me personally, it ranks among the greatest movies of all time.While time may have rendered some aspects of its animation less cutting-edge by today's standards, we must remember that Toy Story was a pioneer in the realm of computer-generated animation. Its release in 1995 marked a watershed moment in the industry, revolutionizing how we perceive animated storytelling.Beyond its technical innovations, Toy Story remains an enduring symbol of nostalgia. It's a film that has grown alongside its audience, becoming an integral part of our collective childhood memories. The characters, from Woody and Buzz Lightyear to Mr. Potato Head, have become cultural icons in their own right, with their endearing personalities and quotable lines etched into the fabric of popular culture.Moreover, Toy Story's narrative transcends its medium. It is not merely a tale of toys coming to life; it delves into themes of friendship, loyalty, and the inevitability of change. Through the adventures of Woody and his fellow toys, it imparts valuable life lessons that resonate with viewers of all ages.In an era of fleeting entertainment, Toy Story endures as a timeless classic. Its ability to captivate and inspire generation after generation is a testament to its enduring brilliance. While the animation may have evolved since its inception, the heart and soul of Toy Story remain as vibrant as ever. It's a cinematic gem that continues to evoke laughter, tears, and a profound sense of wonder‚Äîa true testament to the power of storytelling in the world of film.""",Toy Story

Everything pops and all the characters are super likeable and charming. It's something honestly you could watch with no sound and you could follow the whole thing from start to finish no problem. The message is heartwarming as well. Don't let the childlike premise fool you. This is a All Time Classic that anyone of any age can watch and love.",Toy Story

Its innovative computer animation never overshadows its simple, yet effective story of anthropomorphic 'play things'. Ths voice cast is superb, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen becoming synonymous with their characters. The film also tackles some pretty heavy themes, such as Woody's fear of replacement, and Buzz's disillusionment after coming to know of his nature.

This movie only takes 81 minutes and it flies by without you realising.

Woody, who has been robbed of No.1, and he attacked Buzz, but Buzz thinks he is a real Space Ranger. This is the story of how they worked together to overcome their problems and become good friends.

I love the toys in this film, and I didn't know the toys were alive. This film made me want to cherish toys more.",Toy Story
3,es el origen de una saga bien hecha y primera pelicula de pixar,Toy Story
5,"For anyone who's ever wondered what toys do when people aren't around? Well, it's because this is the first ever computer animated motion picture length movie ever made from Pixar and computer generation. Me and my friends love this movie including Matthew Fender and Nathan Tolson. The scenes in this film are awesome and funny at the same time like the characters. Woody is funny, Buzz is funny and so is the other toys. The scenes where Woody is so jealous at Buzz because he is Andy's new toy so he's thinking about getting rid of him like the scene which I like where Woody pushes Buzz Lightyear out of the window but the other toys think that Woody did it. There's also a scene where the green men discovers what birthday presents that Andy's has got. Come to think of it, the green men really look like the one's from the videogames from PS1 and PS2. There is one green man who is a sergeant played by the guy who played Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. R. Lee Ermey. Can you believe it? There's a scene right where after the green men and before Woody get's jealous, Buzz Lightyear shows the other toys and proves to Woody that he can fly. The scene where Woody and Buzz had a fight at the Petrol Station at the bottom of the car after the dialogue goes through the scene. The hilarious dialogue from Woody and Buzz says is: ''I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.'' ''Oh. Well, that's good.'' ''But we're not on my planet, are we?'' ''No.'' After the truck appears with air horn sound. ''And according to my navi-computer, the...'' ''SHUT UP! Just shut up, you idiot!'' ''Sheriff, this is no time to panic.'' ''This is a perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're gonna move to their new house in two days, and this is all your fault!'' ''My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...'' ''Oh, yeah? Well, if **you** hadn't shown up with your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me...'' ''Don't talk to me about importance! Because of **you**, the future of this entire universe is in jeopardy!'' ''What? What are you talkin' about?'' ''Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg had been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate the entire planet! I alone have information that reveal's this weapon's only weakness. And **you**, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!'' ''YOU - ARE - A... **TOY**! You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear! You're a... aw, you're an action figure! You are a child's play thing!'' ''You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity. Farewell.'' ''Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony!'' ''Rendezvous with Star Command!'' There's a place which Woody and Buzz went called Pizza Planet. When I was a kid, I've been thinking about that Pizza Planet cafe reminds me of McDonalds, my favourite place in my childhood. There's delicious food in there like chicken nuggets, chips and McFlurry. Delicious food in my childhood. They also sell toys here. They went to Pizza Planet to Andy but Buzz just found a spaceship claw full of aliens who treats the claw like god. Woody and Buzz want to get Andy they come across Sid the naughtiest boy who tortures toys for fun. The hilarious scene where Woody is afraid of cannibal toys. I also like the scene where Woody and Buzz accidentally comes across Scud the dog so they have to get past him but was waken up by Woody's string that makes a sound of Woody's voice. Now they had to hide. There is an awesome scene where Woody and Buzz get to the truck where their friends are in. The hilarious scene where Buzz Lightyear is on the RC car being chased by Scud the dog but Scud was trapped by one of the cars. That is awesome! Finally, Woody and Buzz is in the RC car out of batteries so Woody had to light a candle on the rocket but didn't realise he did it to the rocket because he said: ''Wait a minute. I just lit a Rocket. Rockets explode!'' And then zoom, they flew. And while they're flying, Woody has pulled a hilariously funniest silly face he had made. That is funny. Wow! This movie is awesome and hilarious. This had to be the greatest most animated movie that had ever been made in computer for the first time and distributed by Disney Pixar. Tom Hanks really does fit for the role of Woody and Tim Allen really does fit for the role of Buzz Lightyear. All the other cast are great. They have Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Wallace Shawn and Jim Varney voicing Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Rex and Slinky Dog. The animation is fantastic even though this is the first computer animation like I mentioned many times. This movie is nominated for Best Writing, Best Song by Randy Newman singing ''You Got a Friend in Me'' and Best Music by Randy Newman. Hardly enough, I saw Woody and Buzz Lightyear at the Oscars. That is incredible. The place called Pizza Planet makes me think about the videogame I've been playing years ago and that's Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure where you can play all the Disney characters. The places in Toy Story are Andy's Room, Pizza Planet as I explained, and then Zurg's Fortress which wasn't in the first film. I guess this is my No. 1 favourite Pixar film of all time in my childhood. Kinda like being at Toys R Us, doesn't it? In the words of Buzz Lightyear: ''To infinity, and beyond!",Toy Story

4,"An honest to gosh revolutionary classic. What an amazing blend of storytelling, characters, charm, and humor. It might lose its energy at times, but still. 9/10",Toy Story
5,Toy story is a great movie that started Pixar and it's has likable characters and it still holds up to date,Toy Story
3,"Even though this film invented animation, it is very overrated. Not saying it is bad, but it is just meh. The story is predictable especially when there is like 4 or 5 plots going on at once. The animation had definitely shown it's age. And the characters are bland. 6/10 = Okay",Toy Story
4,"Toy Story changed the game for animated cinema. While I don't think it is the best Pixar movie, it is the one that started it all.

I think that I take for granted how incredibly clever this movie is. The core plot is simple, yet profound. The story is full of witty and inspired elements. You could freeze any single frame and see specific detail relating to toys and the world they live in.

The Pixar crew took their time to pay attention to those details and create a true work of art.

4,"Toy Story was a good movie. The animation was a bit too dark ( if you know what I mean) but that's all the flaws. Toy Story is a good movie that is just about old enough to be a classic. I think Toy Story is a bit overrated. I mean, it got an 100%  for critics. Most movies don't get that high up. Also this movie got a 92% for audience. That a bit overrated in my book.But in all, Toy Story was a good movie. I give this movie a 78%.",Toy Story
5,"The most GANGSTER movie ever. It makes me want to get down on the floor and get sturdy. This movie is amazing. I remember pooping myself in woody underwear when I was little.

This is just like Shrek, revolutionary but even more because this was the first 3d computer animated feature film. The voice acting was fantastic for its time and the comedy was awesome üëå .  The ""drama"", us kids say now a days, was great and I love the conflict, I do have nostalgia, though. I 100% recommend if somehow you haven't seen it.

4,"I feel the toy story franchise, is one of the most emotional, and well put together franchises with a few exceptions. I believe that this film said the groundwork for some amazing future Pixar movies. I think the characters have not only become iconic, but they have also developed the opportunity to spin them off into their own series on Disney+ if the right crew got together to do this. I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end, and the sadness of Andy, and the development of the characters without actually having a villain. This was such a fantastic movie.",Toy Story

The story of a group of toys that come to life is timeless, and the characters, including Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the rest of the gang, are beloved by audiences of all ages. The animation is stunning, capturing the playful nature of the toys and bringing the world of the film to life.

5,"Toy Story is total great. The film is very beautifully animated, despite its 1995 origins. The toys' conversations are chuckles. I still remember the scenes when I was a kid. The scene is where Woody and Buzz cooperate with each other to escape from Cid. Overall, the quality is very high, but it would be better if the emotions were a little clearer.",Toy Story

There is nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said already, a certified classic from beginning to end",Toy Story
5,"Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (""I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout""). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",Toy Story
5,"This movie has it all. Simple enough for kids to enjoy while still having just the right amount of subtle humour for adults. In fact, I believe this movie was intended more for adults than for kids because it features a lot of subtle, adult-oriented humour and many of the toys were toys the creators themselves played with as kids.",Toy Story

5,"This is an absolute banger of a classic that, through Pixar, revolutionized animated film and brought about one of the most lovable and creatively endearing duos of the last 30 years.

The voice work in this is exceptional and I am more appreciative of this aspect of the film today as, now being a much bigger film fan, I ""get"" the humorous casting and love the support work from names like Don Rickles, Jim Varney, and R. Lee Ermey even more.

The Randy Newman score may actually turn this Woody and Buzz duo into a tripod as I am not sure Toy Story sees the lasting effect that it has without this comfortingly memorable soundtrack. Newman does so much through the music to create the perfect atmosphere, stirring the audience emotions in just the right way, leaving them with the type of innocently sweet, but never cloying, mental imprint that does not fade quickly.

I think I even enjoyed aspects of the narrative more at this age as well. Themes such as Buzz's ongoing existential crisis, while still comical in some ways, were definitely viewed with a wider lens and appreciated more by me today.

I have never even seen the next three in the franchise and meant to watch the trilogy before four was released. I guess I get a second crack at it now with Lightyear out next week.",Toy Story

4,"üáØüáµ Produced by Studio Ghibli, this animated historical fantasy is directed by Isao Takahata and is an adaptation of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, a 10th century Japanese literary tale. It is the story of a tiny princess found inside a stalk of bamboo who grows rapidly into an exquisite young lady and enthralls all who encounter her, but ultimately she must confront her fate. With a beautiful and stunning art-style of animation reminiscent of old Japanese watercolors, it is an emotionally captivating and melancholic film with a masterful score from Joe Hisaishin, which explores different themes, while presenting various societal, cultural and even religious aspects of the time. It is a wonderful immersive experience with a plethora of sounds that make it very natural, and definitely one of the most memorable films of the studio. I expected no less from an Academy Award nominee!",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"Never did I think a movie could be this perfect, this unmistakable masterful, beautiful spectacle of storytelling, but it did, everything, down to the beautiful animation that truly showed hard work and care put into it, the message that delivers at the perfect time and hammers it in through a powerful and sad scene, the slowness of it allowing one to truly embrace it and take in the experience besides having a giant fast-paced climactic battle, to the sudden change of pace and story bear the end truly hammering in the message that things can be gone in an instant if taken for granted, this is such a perfect movie, and is my absolute favorite movie of all time, it‚Äôs as perfect as any movie gets, this is a masterpiece, and I truly could never understand how it lost to Big Hero 6 at the Oscars(seriously, all my respect for the Oscars has fully been depleted), but minus the fact that it isn't the most enjoyable or entertaining movie out there, it is amazing what art has reached, and sets an ungodly high bar for me as this is my first Ghibli movie, 10/10",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

The art is nothing short of perfect. It encapsulates the feeling of the movie, whether that was purposeful of not is irrelevant, there is no denying it fits so well. The themes of the movie brought me to tears several times. Although decently surface level, the portrayal of wealth vs happiness and the importance of all human emotions was gorgeous.  1 billion out of ten",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"This movie made me feel at a level I haven't experienced since many years. The Art style, the scenes, the mood. It is a masterpiece. I spent years scared to watch it again, in fear of losing that first and strong impression it left on me.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
2,This film is pretty poor üëé,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"Maybe a little overrated? Sure, the animation is beautiful and the story is undeniably heartwarming, but it also drags on much longer than it needs to and misses a ton of opportunities to dive into the characters and their relationships. Instead, it uses this intimidating runtime to get weirdly plotty and explain some stuff that didn't really need explaining.

Somehow the movie's main theme of letting your loved ones do what makes them happy instead of forcing them into a specific life gets completely overshadowed with some weird stuff about not wanting to return to the moon (?), despite the fact that our main character has seemingly not experienced real joy for years. It was just a strange way to climax a movie that seemed like it was building to some obvious, yet powerful emotional moments between the princess and her parents.

But enough complaining! The fact is that this is still a good movie. I've already mentioned the animation, but it can't be overstated how unique and gorgeous it is. The characters have depth and realism that's often missing in animated movies.

It doesn't quite make it on Ghibli's best-of list, but it's a solid watch.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

3,"""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya"" brings my Studio Ghibli journey to a close until the studio releases new films. In a studio known for being unique, this is one of the most unique outings they've had. The story has the magical and whimsical nature they are known for, but the animation is truly one of a kind. Anyone who likes seeing different visual styles of animation needs to watch this movie. Its beautiful simplicity with its visuals is a wonder. I think the story is pretty good too but I mostly appreciated this one because of the visual splendors it provided. Overall, I think this is among the better films from the studio and is just one of many examples of their creative projects.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

5,"It is hard not to be struck by the visual beauty of this masterpiece, a perfect and careful work that turns a folk tale into a story of great depth, nostalgia and tenderness. One of the best animated films of all time, timeless and wonderful; and another great achievement of Studio Ghibli and Isao Takahata.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"With its melancholic story about Princess Kaguya's life journey being forced to grow up fast despite all she ever wanted was to cherish life, The Tale of Princess Kaguya cranked up the emotional impact to nine thousand. In a subtle way, the picture smacks you with emotional beats left and right. When you combine that with the stunning animation that perfectly complements the tale, you have an incredible modern classic that will be discussed in decades to come. Despite the fact that several secondary characters are one-dimensional and the story may alienate some viewers, the pros of this film far outweigh the disadvantages, and it is the closest thing to a perfect film. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is indeed an imaginative art form that neither Pixar nor any other studio has ever produced.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"Through this film, Isao Takahata leaves us an astounding philosophical treatise in which social stratification, gender and spirituality are gently dissected. A declaration of love to the short time we are here alive, an invitation to reflect on it and not waste our precious time and the few chances we get at being happy.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"""The flowers open and the trees bear fruit, even if they fade at last"", the last paragraph is a subtle metaphor for death. The line between clarity and filth is blurred, what you wanted to escape from and what you were looking for become objects of recollection, and the memories of the land, whether joyful or sad, all glow. Eventually you realise that the existence of the world is ultimately a human existence, and that your love of the world is ultimately a love of people. Then you put on your gorgeous cerements and forget all about it, waiting for the next awakening of life as the seasons change.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

4,"A great farewell to Isao Takahata after a turbulent 1990 decade. An immersive and dazzling animation style and the greatest character from this director crowns an almost masterpiece. Here we have a great discussion about humanity versus hunger for social ascention, starring mainly the protagonist and her father. The ending was my only issue. I understood it, but it feels depressing and anticlimatic. However, considering the whole film, it's in the same level of Hayao Miyazaki's movie released on the same year, The Wind Rises.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

3,"Next movie on the Studio Ghibli film list. This is the 5th movie from Isao Takahata (rest in peace). Grave of the Fireflies and My Neighbor the Yamadas were two of my top favorite Ghibli movies. So naturally I was excited for this movie.

Now I get the overwhelming positive and emotional reaction from many viewers, but for me, I didn't feel that much from the movie. The biggest reason for this was probably because I wasn't sure where the movie was going for the first half, and then the twist was a bit sudden.

The animation was the same as in the Yamadas, but this time it was better and more stylistic. 

I was a bit sad at the end. But overall, even though I get the theme, I didn't feel it, and the movie was a bit long. 7/10",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
1,"Alright, so I went into this film optomisticly; ""it's got 100% on rotten tomatoes and is made by studio ghibli,  what a perfect combination!"" I swear, I tried to watch this film for 3 days and was only able to make it 40 minutes in. Before I start my rant, let me clarify 2 things:
1: I am an uncultured American and have no idea what is seen as appropriate in Japan. That being said, a good film is one in which anyone from anywhere can view and enjoy.
2:  credit where credit is due, this film possesses beautiful animation and watercolor artwork, hence why I am not giving only half a star. 
Anyway, without further to do, I have a few criticisms I need to address. For one. This film is rather vulgar in nature; there are many scenes involving nude minors, genitalia, and exposed, growing breasts. I did not expect the amount of vulgarity I saw in this film, and It was extremely uncomfortable for me to sit through. Second. This films early messages and tone were discouraging for me ( I know that i didn't finish and I know that the themes may have strengthened, but as stated, I simply couldn't continue suffering through this film). There are two scenes in particular that bother me; (spoilers)one where the group of kids and kaguya steal a melon from a farmer, and for a second it seems that someone will say something about how it was wrong to do so, as they show the farmer frowning upon seeing his stolen crops. But instead, the greedy kids slice it open and devour it without noting on their unjust actions at all. Aditionally, I was irritated in the scene where they decide to randomly kill a pheasant in cold blood. Heck, one of the characters jumps of a cliff to catch it and kill it, almost injuring himself. Being a bird lover myself, I felt enraged by this vile scene which could have been left out of the film. It adds nothing other than showing how violent and greedy our ""protagonists"" really are. Combined with the vulgar nature of this film, I could not continue watching; i may revisit this film in the future, but for now, my opinion stands strong. I am not trying to discount the mythology behind this film, or discredit the talent and effort put into making it; however, as stated, a great film is one in which all audiences, young, old, black, white, in Greenland or Antarctica, can enjoy and gain something from. While viewers elsewhere may like seeing an old woman's breasts inflate to feed a baby, or seeing a gang of kids kill birds in the woods, I prefer less vulgar content. Say what you want about me not finishing it, but a good film should be watchable from beginning to end in one sitting.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
3,"One of the most beautiful animated films ever. Great themes and story (though it can be hard to understand the point of the ending). What sinks the film is the excessive length. At over two hours, it is episodic and easy to just start waiting for it to end.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,This was a really good movie. It was fun in the beginning but it gets really depressing in the near end and I was in tears. If you're a young adult or a teen I recommend this for you,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

5,The best of the best,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
2,"While visually beautiful, the movie fails to deliver a compelling narrative. It instead relies on the trope of a princess with a mysterious origin and hopes that this concept is enough to fill the entire movie. While the characters are content to puzzle over Kaguya's origin for over 2 hours, the character and animation style failed to keep my interest over the length of the movie.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
3,"The animation here is looser and more impressionistic than in Miyazaki films. That contributes greatly to some scenes, detailed landscapes and the one scene where the princess is running away from the capital, while others can look a little sloppy. The third act gets fairly heavy, and though the specifics in the film make it sound a little ridiculous, it still has a universality that makes the princess's situation relatable. I mean, aren't we all in some sense just princesses dreading the day when we will have to leave Earth and go back to from where we came?",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,The images are beautiful but the movie is way too long!,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

5,"One of the best movies I've ever seen !! Studio Ghibli really knows how to make a legendary movie. From the plot to the animations and the film techniques and soundtrack. Perfect.

4,"The tale of the princess Kaguya is a really heartwarming, touching and beautiful piece of art by Takahata! It would easily be a 5/5 stars movie for me, but unfortunately there are a few scenes that could have been easily cut out, so that the content would be a bit more tight. Still, this japanese folk tale is both happy and tragic, and it makes me cry everytime. Takahata surely left us with a beautiful swan song.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"Extremely powerful, I am still crying.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"Somewhat overt in putting forth its theories on life, happiness, and the role one fulfills, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya still forms some beautifully bittersweet moments, balanced against charm, wholesomeness, and humor. It's real strength lies in its wonderful art style, embracing a watercolor-esque animation technique far different than what Ghibli has come to be associated with. The uniquely melancholic tone, as well, sets the film apart from its contemporaries, and is a unique strength of Takahata as a director. It might not carry the raw power and brutality of Grave of the Fireflies, but the tone is far more nuanced and balances the Japanese folklore basis far better than Pom Poko; to me, it is probably the most complete film by Takahata, given the visual daring and narrative complexity. (4.5/5)",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"A modern animated masterpiece and a fitting swan song for Isao Takahata with beautiful and artsy hand drawn animation  a well-crafted and poignant narrative, profound and thought-provoking themes, and an emotionally affecting and imaginative story based on an ancient Japanese folktale.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,An amazing and gorgeous movie!,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"Watercolour sketched animation style was beautiful, with a wonderful selection of shades and vibrant colours. Stills of the film would make lovely Japanese style paintings, capturing elegant moments of nature with great attention to detail. A particularly memorable scene involved the Princess running away with colourful robes and kimonos left on a path beneath an illuminating moon, which was meticulously framed and had this incredible style of illustration that really stood out. Possibly the most beautifully designed Ghibli piece. Majority of the plot worked nicely which was apparently taken from a Japanese folklore legend (involving a magical Princess found in a bamboo stalk raised by humble country folk). Includes some contentious princes hoping to become her husband being sent on impossible adventures; it reminded me of the fantastical ideas one would find in the iconic Arabian Nights stories. One of my favourite Ghibli works for sure. Only slight criticism was interest waning near the end point ending as it started to introduce ideas around the Princess' origins that failed to connect, and derailed parts of the prior plot and interest in the characters - however it seemed like this was all tied into the folkloric mythical element and did not greatly detract from overall enjoyment.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"Great to see, that Ghibli made a movie based on not just one of the oldest folktales of Japan, but one of the oldest ones in the world. Oh yeah I also like the style of Drawing. Those almost pencil like Graphics make it look like something, we've never seen before from Ghibli (except for the Yamadas but let's ignore that).",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"Started watching Studio Ghibli films only recently, with this film followed only by My Neighbor: Totoro. The art is definitely different and the theme developed into a more mature note towards the end. What I really love about this film is how beautiful the use of watercolor was, especially with the wonderful play in color and intensity throughout the film. Can imagine framing some of the nature scenes  üíï",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
3,"Yeah, I see why it had an Oscar nomination, it's beautiful and every frame is a captivating painting, but still not a perfect animated movie to give it a 100% rating.

4,"A funny, beautiful, melancholic and humour-filled tale. Undeniably handsome, the impressionistic art giving a strange sense of depth and weight and dynamism. 
The film suffers from being a sprawling tale originally, moving through many ages and I found its themes either not translated well or difficult to follow, exactly the point of the tale or the take home message j wasn't sure. I just felt sad and like the entire story wasn't fair on anyone. 
The dub is brilliant, Moretz as Kaguya is personable and spirited and James Caan's warm, sad portrayal of the woodcutter is truly engaging and nuanced.

4,"I'm not a huge anime connoisseur. Before seeing this film I had seen popular anime movies  including Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, Akira and a few others but Princess Kaguya absolutely takes the cake as the best I've seen, and also one of the finest folklore movies I've ever seen, period. Kaguya is beautifully animated, the story keeps your interest throughout the 2.5 hour journey, the English dub is not only tolerable but excellent, and the dialogue is well written and lacks the awkwardness and cheesiness that many anime tend to have. Kaguya has a plethora of themes including the inspirational and healing power of nature, the difficulties of growing up, the curses that beauty/status/wealth can bring, the importance of freedom and playtime, and the importance of letting your children seek their passions. A true masterpiece in storytelling and animation and a movie I will pass on to those I love most.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"Absolutely incredible. The animation, soundtrack and everything else about this is just fantastic! A must see!",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"My favorite movie. One of the deepest stories adapted in the animation medium, this film is proof that adaptations and rip-offs are worthwhile watching or making. The expressionistic visual style accompanies the wonderful story and makes for a great emotional experience. 
 This traditional Japanese folk tale is somehow so relatable that it's one of the few pieces of art that made me cry.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"the soft art really brings out the innocence of the princess, the progression of the softness to the harsh and dramatic art is a great visual representation of her development from a simple little girl to a sheltered and scared woman. overall, a beautiful and original take to a classic tale. wouldn't expect anything less from Studio Ghibli.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"Isao Takahata is my favorite Studio Ghibli director because he puts top notch storytelling on top of creating epic, memorable characters. 
Studio Ghibli's take at this classical Japanese tale is nothing short of awesome. A gorgeous, fully hand-drawn animation, with a style that changes depending on the mood of the scene. The story being told didn't fail to make me emotional several times during the film. Takahata movies rely heavily on the plot so it's really hard to fully praise his work while avoiding spoilers. I will up this review by saying this: It's not your sunday afternoon movie, this isn't some cute animated movie. This is a heartwrenching, 2 hours and 17 minutes experience that will leave you sobbing and appreciating the little things in life.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
3,"The Tale of The Princess Kaguya features beautiful animation, beautiful music and a story that runs too long. Perhaps it's just because I'm not as familiar with Japanese folklore, but I also found it to be a little confusing. My kids weren't very pleased with the ending, either. I'm glad I saw it, but I probably won't be watching it again.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

The story begins with a young princess that is born miraculously through a bamboo tree & grows up naturally with other children, adventure, fun & nature.

When she becomes of age she then is forced into royalty & organized marriage. This is a beautiful & lyrical portrayal of strong young woman & I highly recommend for 12-13 girls & parents alike.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

A unique and profound watch.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is an absolute stunning piece of art. Let's just take a moment to appreciate how beautiful this film is, it is without a doubt a work of art. Every paint stroke, every detail and every frame by frame animation is perfection. I've never seen such exquisite visionary qualities in a film before. Every frame is colourful, bright and absolutely delightful to admire. Not to mention several scenes have multiple layers of animation embedded within them, masterful. I'm just...in awe of how amazing the animation was, I really am. Trust it to be Studio Ghibli, they really are masters of the animation genre. This film is a re-telling of the famous Japanese folk tale ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"" where said bamboo cutter comes across a glowing stalk which is revealed to contain a princess. They raise her as she grows rapidly and, with the help of a divine presence, believe she should be living in the lifestyle of nobility. There is so much to analyse, so much to take in that I just don't have enough words to detail every theme that is explored. The story is one of happiness. The contrasting lifestyles of rural village people to rich noblemen. But is anyone actually truly happy? Princess Kaguya wishes to live back in the mountains whereas her old friends are jealous of her new luxurious residence. Within this personal conflict is the never ending battle of seeking true happiness which conclusively she does not find (much like everyone else in life). The bamboo cutter gave the princess a life in his own image, a life that he wished he desired all along. While he may have been happy, his daughter was not. He was blinded by the materialistic aspirations that he yearned for. The representation of the traditional Japanese culture was wonderful and really captured the authenticity of the folk tale. I do have to warn you though, don't let the cutesy animation fool you. I do not recommend this for children. It's a long runtime, there are heavy themes and I don't think they will fully appreciate it.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"Few animated films have such an exquisite blend of maturity and complexity. This truly is a Ghibli masterpiece, worthy to be compared with the best of all animated films. Kaguya boasts breath-taking artwork, complex emotions, satirical jabs at societal norms, powerful characters with real motives and incentives, and a depth that is likely to leave one pondering the themes of this film for sometime.

I was left thorougly dissapointed with the story; I personally couldn't connect with the character as a major fan of the original story, I tried my best to differentiate the stories but could not get over that the character was thoroughly different from the book. The animation was beautiful, different from any other animation movie I have seen, it's nice to see something so unique in a time where computer animation and high detailed films are created; this film was left raw, like the characters and story, which I liked.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

5,"The swan song of 78 year old director, Isao Takahata, The Tale of Princess Kaguya is an ethereal fluid, seamless brushstroke animation that unrolls like the Ukio-e scroll which Princess Kaguya playfully unrolls across the tatami mats.  You get the sense that the scenes are being painted as you're watching it.  What Takahata has accomplished is the next level of Anime, of animation, and of filmmaking in general.  The animation as well as the story are deceptively simple, but are full of complex & sophisticated flavours which will leave you satisfied, much like genuine Japanese cuisine and culture.  
The story is taken from the oldest recorded Japanese folktale, The Legend of the Bamboo Cutter's Daughter. Its themes are the simple joys of human life & the sadness of conforming to cultural norms. 
The music is also beautifully minimalistic.  The koto music is exquisite.
After watching the DVD's special features, you can see that Princess Kaguya had a long, painful labour, unlike the character in the film who comes miraculously out of a takenoko, a bamboo shoot.
There were a few times I thought of other films while watching this one. Near the end of this film, it has some similarities to Wim Wenders' classic, Wings of Desire, in that there are otherworldly beings wanting to experience the joys of human existence, the small pleasures of which most of us are unaware.  Also, the flying scene is very Miyazaki-ish. 
My only complaints have nothing to do with the film itself:
- The tagline of ""The Crime & Punishment of a Princess"" has nothing to do with this film at all.
- It seems like any animated film is automatically labelled as a kid's movie.  Not so in Japan, Anime is not just for kids; it's for everyone.  There's even animated porn!  In regards to The Tale of Princess Kaguya, the Okanagan Regional Library has it listed under Junior DVD, which definitely this film is not.
- Also, actors who have dubbed the English versions are always given more status than anyone else.  After working on a film for 8 long years, it's not fair that someone else who spent a weekend in a sound booth gets higher billing than you.  
This work of art has taken and will stay in an exalted place amongst Studio Ghibli's vast annals of masterpieces.

This is an animation that achieves to convey emotions, as delight and sorrow. Not every movie deserves to be called a masterpiece, but even weeks after I'd watched the movie for the first time, I still thought about it and it touched my heart in a very different way.

I must admit, that emotional wrenching aside, it is - just magnificent!

The art will blow your mind! At times so simple and yet so complex! The story is definitely original and takes unusual and unexpected twists and turns. 

The reluctant princess herself is just a joy to behold! Talk about reminding you to really just enjoy life for what it is, not all decorated and gilded in false tinsel and shine!

3,"STANDARD REVIEW: Even though I don't know much about the original folklore tale that this movie was based on, this film is the best non-directed Miyazaki Ghibli film that has ever been made. Although I have only seen three Studio Ghibli films that weren't directed by Miyazaki, this film is surprisingly better than most of his works and also pretty damn tragic when you think about it. This film (At least in my opinion) is better than Laputa, Totoro and Porco Rosso, heck it WOULD even rank up there with the masterpieces of Mononoke and Spirited Away but not better. Yeah, we've seen this type of story before with princesses being rebellious against tradition, who longs for a break out in the country, but the way the story is told and the animation itself help tell the story in such a mystical way that I just got completely lost in this movie's world. I have not felt this way about a film for a LONG time. In fact I cried from this movie and I haven't done that in years (Trust me, years!). Told with such mysticism and attention, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya would've been a timeless classic that I would've enjoyed everytime I see it, no matter my age. Recommended for the whole family, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a soon to be classic that will be remembered for a long time.

RANTING TIME: OMFG!! This is the worst ending to a Studio Ghibli film I have ever seen in my life! I will admit that:

	It has been a long time since I cried at a movie's ending
	It has been a long time since I was this mystified by a movie's setting/story (This goes back to something like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke)
	It has been a long time since I have seen such a goddam perfect movie like this

But this movie has one of the MOST anti-climactic endings of all time! I have never, EVER seen such a perfect movie ruin itself so hard, three minutes before its ending. Everything was absolutely perfect for me, until those last three minutes. Death Note's last 12 episodes are NOTHING compared to the rate of speed that this movie nosedives into shitville. I have never, ever seen a movie go so downhill, so fast, so hard yet still be more affecting than a 12 episode dive into shitville. I have a feeling this is how a lot of Star Trek fans felt, when they had to sit through the last 15 minutes of Into Darkness' ending. I don't usually reference other forms of pop culture here but for this rant, I'm definitely going to need to.

(SPOILERS) All her life, the Princess has never had one spec of happiness in her life. The moment she left for the Capital, she has always been in the wrong place all the time. She's never loved (Sort off), never enjoyed herself in the Capital and never even makes a genuine goodbye to ANYBODY! In the fair few months she lived in the countryside (I think it was months anyways) were the only real genuine moments of happiness she has had in her ""mortal life."" Compared that too the years of living in the Capital and you can tell that for most part, the Princess had a pretty crappy mortal time. And of course she forgets all that anyway, so it doesn't even matter anymore, which makes it all the MORE heartbreaking. And don't get me wrong tragedy is fine, just make sure that it ends well! The real title of this movie should've been ""The Tragic Tale of the Princess Kaguya.""

I get the type of ending that this movie was going for (I think). But the problem with that is the scene itself was so anti-climactic that it ruins any emotional buildup that the movie had going for itself. It almost makes the whole film utterly pointless. If you're going to go the ""E.T. go home,"" route, HAVE A ""E.T. right here,"" MOMENT DAMN IT!! The ending literally has her mid speech about the world's beauty and then all of sudden *PUFF MOTHERF*CKER! We don't give a f*ck about what you have to say! Get on the magic carpet B*TCH!* Personally, this film would've been much, MUCH better if they would just let the Princess have her moment and let her spew about how ""The world is a cruel place but also very beautiful,"" speech and persuade the moon people (Or whatever they're called) that she is not sad and that she wants to stay! As corny as that maybe, personally I would've found that a much more fitting/better ending then what we actually got anyways. It would've fit in the context of the stories fairy tale-like structure and kept itself true to what could've been a goddamn masterpiece that ranks up there with Ghibli's best like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. Freaking Ponyo had a better ending than this! The good stuff in this film unfortunately just wasn't enough for me to say it compensated those last three minutes (That somehow completely ruined everything?). But I still standby my statement, when I say that this movie is one of Ghibli's best non-Miyazaki directed films, just not one I would re-watch a lot unfortunately.

The only reason why I cried at this movie was the multitude of emotions going through my brain as I reacted to those last three minutes. To have her just leave like that WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOODBYE! And forget EVERYTHING she's experienced, itself was so hard to watch. It was just soooo shocking to see such a perfect movie, completely destroy itself in just three minutes and it pains me too because I loved this movie so much for 98.94% of the time and for those last three minutes to exist is just jarring to me. Don't get me wrong, I still liked this movie but, my god (Facepalm). I really wanted to forget those last three minutes and just mindlessly enjoy this film to no end but I just can't, I really REALLY cannot do it, no matter how hard I try :( This rant shouldn't exist and those last three minutes shouldn't exist! (SPOILERS)

5,"This along with The Wind Rises is one of the more serious Studio Ghibli films. It is not a children's film like Totoro, and adventure like Princess Mononoke, or a fantasia like Spirited Away. It is a deep critique of sexism and tradition and at the same time a celebration of the subtle arts and naturalism of Japanese culture. Hands down the most beautiful animation I have *ever* seen in a feature-length film - bold kawaii aesthetic is replaced by watercolor naturalism.  Beautiful music as well. The Princess's servant girl provides some comic kawaii relief.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

They decide to raise her as their own and come to decide she should be a princess. She learns the ways of a princess and how to be proper all the time missing the time she grew up. Kaguya struggles with this and deals with all the ups and downs in life from courtship, regulations and maturity.

3,"Moving and imaginative in its simplicity and rawness, a throwback to an animated era of yesteryear, detailing a legend from even further back. The painted colours and minimalist lines show Takahata's longing to tell an emotive tale of how much he and the moon/bamboo princess long to remain, and why not, for every world and studio needs its artistic art-house films and filmmakers, to carry literary imagination onto the silver screen.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

4,"This is a beautiful, visually distinct film with narrative depth and realistic characters mixing with the element of fantasy, it's a modern animated masterpiece. My one problem is that multiple scenes are pretty slow moving and last a lot longer than what they need to be (in my opinion).",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"Studio Ghibli fans will notice several departures from most of the studio's previous work: the art style is far less vivid, relying largely on pale pastels; and despite the editing of the trailers, there is little real adventure in the narrative. That none of the film's impact should be dulled by these changes is a testament to the quality of the studio's work, and could make one question if the only reason Miyazaki is highlighted in coverage of Ghibli is because it's easier to focus one's gratitude on a single figure.

In the tradition of the best folktales, The Tale of Princess Kaguya celebrates life and strangeness, becoming ever-more magical and bittersweet as it progresses. There is a slight slump in pacing near the middle of the film, but even that is suddenly broken with a breathtaking sequence relying on gesture drawings. Kaguya may not be as consistent as the best of Ghibli's work, but one way or another, it will leave you breathless; some for only a few moments, others for half the movie.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

5,"In my opinion, ""Kaguya Monogatari"" is one of the best titles produced by Studio Ghibli. The folktale is very touching itself, but this film brings a completely different feeling ...
Symbolic images of Princess Kaguya makes us feel sad, happy, regretful, and serene at the same time, help us to realize the reason we exist. We are all born innocent, but this world set us to certain positions, sometimes you want to escape, but simply cant , because that is the fate of one ""human"". The remaining by your side is just beautiful feelings that you can never forget...
The soundtracks of this film, what can I say ? Simply Studio Ghibli, fantastic as ever. The animations are abnormal, but it makes people feel that this film is a ""folktale"", not an Anime movie, and of course, should be considered as another masterpiece of Isao Takahata (I love ""Grave of the Fireflies"" so much ^_^)...",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

5,"It's like watching a painting, so beautiful. Kaguya is a much deeper, and more serious movie than the other Studio Ghibli movies we have seen (those are all Miyazaki's). In our house at least, this wouldn't have been enjoyed by the kids. Perhaps because of the theme. I loved that it was a folktale, and seemingly kept as it should be, rooted in Japanese culture. The clothes, countryside, and city all lend themselves so well to the animation style. It stays true to folktale, like Grimm's or Andersen's which are sad. This isn't a Disney-fied version (I do love Disney though) making it happily ever after. Sadly, I don't think my kids would appreciate it. I found it sad at several moments, but there are beautiful scenes of pure joy.

The backdrop of the story was so finely described according to the ancient Japanese cultures & beliefs. The theme of the story is so pure & genuinely simple. Great work as it is so out-standing exceptionally in today's world which craves so much in different kind of effects to tell a story in movies. :-D,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"An amazing work of animated art. Isao Takahata has already made what I think is the best animated movie I've ever seen, Grave of the Fireflies. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is now pretty high up there as well. I can't pretend to understand every little bit of the movie, but what an experience it was. Gorgeous, unique animation, made in the style of what I'd call Japanese impressionism (I don't know what officially this style is called). Reportedly it has taken Isao Takahata 8-10 years to complete the movie; like Miyazaki with The Wind Rises, Takahta is obviously at the pinnacle of his craft here. What amazing swan songs for both of them if indeed these are their last movies (along with the legacy of their Studio Ghibli after it releases one final film, I believe). The world of animation will indeed be a diminished one once Takahata and Miyazaki leave us.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

4,"A long animated film that's telling an old Japanese tale, the tale of Princess Kaguya. The story us touching and weird - in a good way. A fairytale for grown-ups, being depressing and bringing up some sort of moral.

It's quite easy to catch the massage here, you get the main point after 20 minutes or so. It does not ruin much, but weighing in at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's maybe a bit too long. The story aside, this is fantastic craftmanship! The used visual technique makes this film. It's like a living aquarelle painting. Often painted with weaker tones - backed with smaller amounts of stronger colors. The music is also incredible and very fitting. I watched most of the film with English dubbing. Maybe wise, maybe not. It was clearly easier to hang on to then, and Chlo√´ Grace Moretz was both fitting and impressive when giving her voice.

Kaguya was definitely robbed of an Oscar - it beats the mediocre ""Big Hero Six"" by miles when it comes to orignality and execution.

An impressive and delightful experience. It's solid all over, but it's a bit long and it could have brought me more emotions. Guess I'm not that connected to ancient Japanese culture - even if I dig it.

8 out of 10 kotos.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
5,"Easily stands among the best of Ghibli and - as a result - animation/film in general. I don't think it's Takahata's best film, but it is more than worthy of his talents.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"A beautiful story that transcends emotionally and spiritually.

I have not watched many Japanese animation films. The only the other I have seen except this one is Spirited Away. But now I really consider watching them looking at the skills of the directors Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, etc. The tale of Princess Kaguya based on an old Japanese folktale is the story of a mysterious girl(named Kaguya later) who is discovered by a bamboo cutter in a bamboo stalk. He and his wife the raise baby girl as their own.Their house is situated in greenery of remote village in the mountains. Kaguya seems to grow very rapidly and becomes very close friends with gang of children in the neighborhood. Merrily singing and playing they enjoy the nature and Kaguya is having the most joyous time in her life. 

Her father though, envisions great things after he finds gold and fine clothes in other bamboo stalks. He thinks heaven wants Kaguya to become a princess and they need to raise her in that way. So off they go to the city and become a noble family with their gold. Kaguya who is initial happy with all the royal treatment soon understands the sorrows and bitterness in life when things are forced onto her. The story slightly loses its steam after the breezy first hour and I feel the run time could have been short by about 20 minutes. It dwells into complex themes of our world full of deceit and sorrow and the perceptions of cycles of life, afterlife hidden under its straight forward narrative. At times things get difficult to understand, still the visuals are so beautiful that you are completely engrossed into the scenery forgetting about the story. The ending which left me dazed was quite emotional and spiritually powerful. Despite some loose ends, the movie is overall well crafted with beautiful hand drawn animation and music. I felt it was emotionally moving and deeply profound.

Overall, this film reaches a deep scope within its story in a way that encourages emotional resonance and thoughts from the audience.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"If THE TALE OF THE PRINCESS KAGUYA is to be Isao Takahata's last film, at the very least we can say he has ended his career on a graceful note.  That's more than can be said for Hayao Miyazaki's technically beautiful but often meandering swan song THE WIND RISES.  Gorgeously rendered in a rich watercolor pastel style out of an old picture book, this melancholy animated feature, based on a Japanese folklore tale, centers on a bamboo cutter who adopts a girl who turns out to be anything but ordinary.  The girl grows quite rapidly from a precociously adorable child to a young lady, but her simple world is turned upside down when her misguided ""father"" decides that royalty is the life she's destined for.  As is usual per a Ghibli movie, the animation is top-notch and rich with detail, even in its stylized mode, and if the film seems long, the dynamics between the title character and her parents -- arguably the real anchor of the film, even more so than a tragic love subplot of sorts involving a poor farm boy -- are presented in a sincere, emotional way that transcends this film from being just another animation showcase.  Joe Hisaishi's music is also a plus, particularly the koto-flavored folksongs that occasionally pepper the film.  It should be warned, though, that this movie does have a few moments that stretch into ""adult"" territory (a scene where a child drinks from her mother's mammary, as well as a few shots of nude children), but it is inoffensively presented and frankly, hardly a detriment.  The bittersweet final fifteen minutes will also encourage the viewer to have tissues in store.  Not only beautiful to look at, but to watch as well, this ""princess"" is a royal treat.  The dub is, for the most part, very well done, with James Caan and Mary Steenburgen turning in solid performances as the bamboo cutter and his wife, respectively.  Chlo√´ Grace Moretz has a fitting voice for the title character and is mostly good, but sometimes she falls a bit flat during the more emotional moments.  The sparse narration also borders on occasional pandering as well.  The rest of the cast is fine, especially the children in the opening scenes.  There are a couple of places where the dialogue sounds rushed, but otherwise, the script is adapted fairly smoothly.  It's easily livelier and superior to the more lifeless WIND RISES dub.  Still, if you can't stand the dub, there's always the original Japanese track.  Either way, a lovely film.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

4,"It does not take a hardcore animation fan to discern that ""The Tale of The Princess Kaguya"" is a good film. The sketchbook visual look, (a rarity for Studio Ghibli, only done in their 1999 ""My Neighbors the Yamadas,"") the strong vocals of Chloe Moretz and Lucy Liu, and the overall classic 'Old Japan' feel of the whole piece is well done. Perhaps the single most breathtaking (and talked about) animated sequence in recent HISTORY is cradled in the second-half of this film, the scene where our princess protagonist blasts through a series of doors like a human rocket in a fit of intense rage, accompanied by abstract shapes, and hastily-sketched charcoal-inspired outlines. The wonder and excitement in this scene is hard to describe, and the only way to do so is calling it ""an artist's sketchbook come to life."" This brief, fantastically drawn sequence is outstanding and is worth more than all the photorealistic CGI Hollywood has to dish up. However, with that said, Princess Kaguya shows that, as I feared with ""Poppy Hill"" and ""Arrietty,"" Studio Ghibli is becoming far too conservative for their own good. True, there is joy, sadness, and true emotions in ""Kaguya,"" but not in heaping platefulls like past efforts like ""Spirited Away,"" ""Porco Rosso,"" or ""My Neighbor Totoro,""to name a few. Heck, Isao Takahata's 1994 ""Pom Poco,"" (his least famous film,) contains more visual excitement and originality in its first 20 minutes than this entire film. We as audiences get the miraculous birth of Kaguya almost in the first scene of the 2 hour-long-anime, but there is nothing really miraculous till the last moments when *** spoiler*** the moon people bring Kaguya back to her rightful home with a cloud of joyous, melodious entities. I wanted to see more life, more wonder, more legendary ""wow"" moments so typical in ancient folklore. I felt hungry for more. Still, ""Princess Kaguya"" was a fine film, and a bittersweet goodbye to legendary Ghibli co-founder Takahata. This is Studio Ghibli's second to last film and for that fact alone, it must be cherished and protected till the end of time.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

It's directed  by Master director Isao Takahata who co-founded Studio Ghibli with Hayao Miyazaki.  It's long for an animated film at 2hr15mins, but well worth it and deserving of its Oscar nomination.  Give it a try!",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"Beautifully animated and a compelling story, although the ending is perhaps slightly unsatisfactory.
The main characters were drawn so aptly, with the supporting cast fittingly relegated to broad brush strokes and ill-defined features.

There is no way to say that this Studio Ghibli's masterpiece's idiosyncrasy is not unambiguous, for there is nothing like it. This movie is reminiscent of coming-of-age, and as one never is the same following their childhood, thus is the effect of this movie.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

3,The animation is like a beautifully crafted childrens book. It is so simple but beautiful and story unfolds like a good fairytale however the third act gets a bit odd (Buddha shows up and comes across as a bit mean) and it felt like it lost it narrative edge by going down this route instead of having a more accessible ending but still enjoyable up until this point.,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

4,Magical and beautifully drawn and made.,The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
3,"Beautiful animation. Cute, whimsical story.

I think I honestly prefer this unique sketch-style animation to the usual anime I'm accustomed to (admittedly, I haven't seen too many). Without losing much detail or emotive ability, the animators employ a noticeably dressed down technique that shows off the hand-drawn line in its simplicity and beauty.

The story is cute and touching, with lots of intriguing glimpses of Japanese myth and culture. Unfortunately, the film's second act really drags. It's not that there isn't interesting stuff going on here. There's simply a very deliberate hand guiding the story that prefers to very gradually depict the passing of time (ironic considering the title character's growth process is magically truncated within the narrative). Honestly, I dozed off numerous times and kept having to rewind the BluRay. This yarn most certainly could be weaved without crossing the two hour mark.

All in all, like many traditionally animated films in recent years, I'd recommend The Tale of Princess Kaguya on the merit of its beautiful animation style alone. While the story is emotionally captivating in many ways, it tends to plod along in its second act. But admittedly, this animation deserves to be seen and marveled at from beginning to end.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya
4,"This is truly the best animation movie of 2014 

The tale of the Princess Kaguya brings in the japanese tale about princess kaguya and her journey to find the meaning of happiness.

Since this is Ghibli studio movie , it's for sure still amazing looking movie but even more stunning with it's japanese painting style , and even that the movement of characters in the movie is still really good and some scene which character moving really fast it's just so amazing and so beautiful to watch.

With that and Isao Takahata great storytelling just make this movie a really top list of animation movies.

One thing that really make a lot of people angry is the ending of this movie which is not a surprise consider Isao Takahata famous movie like Grave of the Fireflies but honestly i personally really like the ending because it's just fit to the theme of this movie so much.

and that theme is talking about finding the ""happiness"" but in the reality world it's not that easy and sometimes you just can't change everything especially the terrible fate that waiting for you and that what's The tale of the princess kaguya talks about.

In the end this movie is truly the best animation movie of 2014 without any doubt in my mind , and maybe even the best movie of studio Ghibli.",The Tale of the Princess Kaguya

4,"This was a delight! Finally watched it and it reminded me so much of the time I made a horror short with some friends a couple years ago. We too attempted to do it as a one shot (just seven minutes and not 35, and with way less people involved), and it's so damn hard. Everything about filmmaking is hard, every unexpected thing that could possibly happen to you WILL happen. So, as I watched the first 30 mins, I was delighted at seeing the craft and the energy of a one shot horror flick on screen, and then I was delighted to see it all come together in the most unexpected and funny way possible. So many details! This film felt so honest and I was with the characters every step of the way.

initial rating 1/5: wow - seeing these ratings & reading other's reviews, i guess i better re-watch this one sometime. i could barely watch the first 10 minutes before i shut it off; i thought it was absolutely awful. but apparently i should've tried to stick it out a little longer. until then -",One Cut of the Dead
3,"This generation's Blair Witch Project. Not because it created a new subgenre or because it's particularly scary, but due to the fact that it racked up more ticket sales than its budget to an almost impossible degree; a $25,000 movie that took in more than $30,000,000. 

I went in totally blind to the layers that were going to be on display in this film, which ended up delivering a twist on the zombie and zomedy genres through multiple meta aspects - showing a film, then diving into the creative inspiration behind it and then ultimately the behind-the-scenes footage, weaving in jokes about the sporadic nature of creating a film, the tricks of the trade, and the slip-ups along the way. It's as much about the development process as it is about the zombie flick that it lovingly satirizes, and the film also features a legitimate long take as its central device (a fully contained short film running 37 minutes in length), which is an impressive enough feat on its own, but then the film has this surprisingly elaborate structure that sets up not only multifaceted characters but an interesting design (if you count the end credits, I think this film ends up four Inception layers deep, a director creating a film about a director creating a film about a director creating a film about zombies).

I'm not sure it's a herald of a shift in filmmaking style that the consistently high praise seems to suggest, but it certainly is clever and fun. (3.5/5)",One Cut of the Dead
3,"This is quite a clever film. I won't provide many spoilers, I'll just say that its not what it first seems, in more ways than one. It doesn't seem especially amusing at first but there are certainly comedic moments present.

Its quirky and entertaining. Yes, I'd recommend it.",One Cut of the Dead

That's not the gold i mean probably most of people guessed it as well as me but that's not even the point the actual point is how beautifly they have showed us the films are made, how smooth it was.

Like a charming animal-destruction free version of¬†Cannibal Holocaust, the movie has three different ways that the story is told, changing with each new telling of the tale. Higurashi, the director, is losing money and needs to finish his film, but he hates how it kooks. So he makes a blood pentagram that activates real zombies that start biting his crew and actors while he keeps screaming for them to keep shooting, no matter what.

And honestly, if I tell you anything that happens after the actress Chinatsu kills him and stands inside the pentagram in a trance, it will ruin what was one of the best movies I've seen in some time.

For the first 50 minutes I was confused on why this movie was so highly praised. It's kinda funny and looked like an amateur work. 

Then the last half came, and now I understand the hype. This was definitely one of the most ingenious concept and execution.

3,"Shinichirou Ueda's critically acclaimed zombie film boasts an intriguing premise; a low budget production of a zombie film is interrupted on location by a real life zombie attack. The film is split into three distinct parts, and the supposed originality of it has got everyone raving. The problem is that the first third is interesting for a short while as you try to figure out exactly what's happening, but starts to grate towards the end. We know of course that there is a deliberation in the shoddy quality of the production and the acting, we just don't find out the full reasons why until the final third of the film, which is simply the first part seen from a different perspective. This set up in general isn't original of course, we've seen it as far back as Rashomon (1950) and in plenty of more recent films; for example Vantage Point back in 2008. One Cut Of The Dead might  simply be claiming originality in the zombie genre sense, and that's fine- but by the time we fully realise the films intentions, I personally had become tired of it. Many disagree, and it is at the very least, interesting to see the final third, but it failed to make the impression on me that I had hoped for.",One Cut of the Dead

Acting: 10

Beginning: 10

Characters: 6

Cinematography/Visuals: 10
From a visual standpoint, I can honestly say I've never seen anything like this movie before. Watching this movie unfold is like seeing someone play with one of those things that's a toy inside a toy inside a toy. No shot is wasted here and every angle tells a different part of the story. Director Shinichiro Ueda does a masterful job across the board. Overall, it has a gritty old school feel to it, much like Tarantino's Planet Terror.

Conflict: 10

Entertainment Value: 9
There is so much packed into 96 minutes, it's hard not to be overly entertained the whole time. I didn't give it a perfect score as there were some moments where I was more confused than I was hoping for. It's truly a wild ride where you feel like things are constantly out of control.

Memorability: 10

Pace: 6
Things move at a decent pace until about the forty-five-minute mark where the movie slows down drastically. I understand the shift, but it took away from the momentum for me a bit. Despite the momentum shift, the movie is highly enjoyable overall.

""Surely, there couldn't be any surprises judging from the recent mindless additions to the genre of the mindless creatures, right? RIGHT?!"" And boy, was I wrong! One Cut of the Dead might be one of the most enjoyable films I've ever watched.

Written and directed by Shin'ichir√¥ Ueda, this film shattered all my assumptions and took me on a ride so entertaining that I think I laughed 30 minutes straight during the entire third act.

The film was made in just 8 days with a small budget of around $25,000 and a cast of unknown actors. After it's success at the Udine Film Festival, it was re-released, and eventually grossed $30.5 million worldwide, earning over a thousand times its budget.

If that doesn't impress you, the fact that the first 37 minutes of the film is done in ONE CUT should. Some viewers dislike the first 37 minutes and find it challenging to get through. I, however, enjoyed it and found the awkward moments and general cheesiness hilarious.

Now, I will deliberately avoid going into the plot for this particular film because I'm afraid anything I say might injure the experience for you. I went in completely blind into this. I watched no trailers and read no reviews apart from one which suggested that sticking with it for the first 30 minutes is worth it because of the incredible payoff. I'm glad I listened to it. Just remember that every awkwardness and cheesiness in the initial 37 minutes has a reason, and the payoff is indeed extraordinary.

While performances by the entire cast were wonderful, I was especially drawn by Takayuki Hamatsu (Director Higurashi) and Harumi Shuhama (Nao). I will doubtless watch out for their other works.

Lastly, the film makes great use of cinematography, editing, and sound.

To wrap up, I'd say Shin'ichir√¥ Ueda's One Cut of the Dead is nothing shy of a masterpiece and is full of originality, humour, wit, and creativity. It amazed me in every aspect and delighted me in forms no film has in a long time. During the last 30 minutes of the film, I remained glued to the screen and didn't think, do or say anything except absorbing what was happening in front of me. I came out on the other side thoroughly impressed, satisfied, and with my face aching from all the hilarity. I will watch out for Shin'ichir√¥ Ueda's other works.",One Cut of the Dead

5,"ACTION!

Some novels trust you to be able to stick with strange decisions and styles to push through to a few final pages or chapters or lines that achieve the near-impossible, they redefine and reframe the previous ones, they shed a new light, and radically change your thoughts on the previous material/project as a whole.

That happens in this film. To discuss it any further is to completely ruin it. Suffice to say, it is every bit as good as it is being touted as. It's got clever commentary and a style of comedy that means you can actually be laughing before they even show you anything. I'm still laughing about it today, and I think it even manages to take Zombies and be the first film of this decade to give them a new thematic meaning.

It's got a denouement too many, but they've earned it: I watched this film at the Sitges film festival and the filmmakers and cast received a standing ovation, at which, I was almost in tears, not only because they thoroughly deserved it, but also because they managed to make a film about what making a film is about. It captures almost all of what it feels like in an authentic and different way to usual, and it uses its budget to make a film about making a film at that budget perfectly.

I have no doubt that this cast and crew (of whom none have a single IMDB headshot image!) will get One Cut of the Dead will get a distributor and achieve worldwide success and acclaim, it's just too special and genuine and innovative not to.

And it even manages to correct that fact that it ‚Äòshould' have been called One Take of the Dead in a way that satisfies a pedant like me! Time to get off my arse and make something‚Ä¶

One Cut Of The Dead

The screenwriter and the director Shinichiro Ueda has made a wrong film. It is not odd, but wrong. A film like this should never succeed. It shouldn't even work. And yet against all odds. All methods. Procedures. Years of experience. History, to learn from. Inspire form. It is a beautiful film. Guillermo del Toro says that within the first ten minutes of the film, you can tell how the film is. And it is rare for a film then to change your mind. And this happens in here. But that was planned. The film is structured in a way to throw you off the hook.

So when the time comes to grab you with both of its hands, the film never leaves you and your sight. And the makers does this by keeping an audience member, even us, at certain moments, in that shot. We are the uncredited character. And the most valuable one. If the first act, the One Cut Of The Dead, that first shot keeps us behind the camera, in front of the screen, where we are now, the fourth wall then breaks down as we start exploring the ""making"" of that act.

And by then, a character is tagged for enacting like the audience, and his or her reaction is captured perpetually and shown to us. It may even drive your feelings as how you might take that scene. And it is satisfying for these characters to hold the film together- both the one in the film and the one itself- convincing us to participate and enjoy. And this is an important fabric of the storyline. For the last shot of the film is them taking a sigh of relief from working hard. That relaxation isn't something you can achieve, if you don't care for them or if you have not invested in the process.",One Cut of the Dead

As a humanitarian I certainly support Special Olympics and applaud similar encouragements within the movie industry. Bravo, Say I.",One Cut of the Dead
4,"One Cut Of The Dead was a school project. A partially-funded-by-crowdsourcing, the-actor/students-paid-to-be-in-it, made for $23,000 school project. All of the actors are students of Enbu Seminar, a film school in Tokyo, and this movie was a workshop (a.k.a., a class) made under the school's Cinema Project banner. With that kind of pedigree you'd be forgiven if you had a moment of doubt when trying to decide whether or not to see it. Truth be told, I had a moment of doubt before pressing [PLAY] even after seeing the trailer. Scratch that. Especially after seeing the trailer. ""Please,"" I prayed to The Great Old Ones Beyond The Veil. ""Don't let this be another micro-budget zombie movie.""

Much to my surprise They listened.

What ultimately had me pressing play was the promise of a 37-minute long take with one camera in a zombie movie. No cuts. The logistics of that is horrific enough on its own! It's like trying to build a scale model of the Great Pyramid of Giza with three of your best friends, two cases of beer, and a blindfolded donkey in one afternoon. You're either going to fail completely or someone's going to get seriously injured in the process. But! And this is a big, beautiful 37-minute ""but""... they did it. One take. One camera. Thirty-seven minutes. It was a wonder to behold.

It told the story of a film crew making a low-budget zombie movie in an abandoned Japanese World War II military installation. Supposedly, it was a water filtration plant, but word on the street said it had been used by the Japanese military for secret experiments in bringing the dead back to life. Natch. Maybe not a good spot for a family picnic, but hey! Great location for a zombie movie. That is, until the overzealous director calls forth the undead to bring more realism to his crappy little movie.

Sure, it wasn't 28 Days Later (2002). There were awkward pauses by the actors, scenes that went on too long, and special effects that weren't particularly special. And then Ueda's brilliance kicked in.

Without giving too much away -- and I don't think I am since it's a 96 minute movie and I've only described 37 minutes of it -- this is where One Cut Of The Dead shifts gears. Every awkward pause, every slip-and-fall of the cameraman, every overly extended scene, every single second of that 37 minutes is cleverly, actively, and thoroughly explained. Up to and including the reason behind the whole low-budget zombie movie itself.

One Cut Of The Dead is a showcase for the heart, dedication, and passion that making movies is all about. Takayuki Hamatsu puts in an inspired performance as Mr. ""I'm fast, cheap, but average"" Higurashi, director of the doomed zombie flick. Harumi Shuhama who plays his wife and make-up artist, Nao, has the comedic timing of an industry veteran. Yuzuki Akiyama and Kazuaki Nagaya bring astounding energy to the screen as J-Pop-Idol-Turned-Actress, Chinatsu, and entitled teen heartthrob, Ko.

Very much a zombie-based horror/comedy -- or, ZomCom -- One Cut Of The Dead is full of irreverent jokes at the film industry's expense. Not mean-spirited in any way; more as a kind of roast of the process. It's a tongue-in-cheek peek behind the curtain hiding the ""magic"" of filmmaking. Giving us a glimpse of the difficulties and ridiculousness that are often part and parcel of getting our favorite genre up onto the silver screen.

This movie is as must see as they get.  If you're a fan of the horror genre, do yourself a favor: watch the trailer, avoid all spoilers, and go see this film. Trust me, this is one of those experiences that's best when you know very little about it.

Pom!

3,"I'm a bit surprised at how very positive the reviews are.  I watched this at home and I got interrupted so I didn't get to see how it wrapped up, maybe that was necessary for a real appreciation.   In short ... the subject matter exposed here was both important and overdue, and the real-life evidence of what abuse does to a child was absolutely, incontestably captured here.  On that score, as well as my opened eyes and pity for the survivors, I'd give it five stars.  


However, I felt like it desperately needed editing.  I found myself saying wait, who?  Larry?  Weren't we talking about Howard?  Who's Stewart again? What's the timeline here?  Why am I seeing this piece of footage again?  Are we doing a reverb on this byte to show that people might have known but chose to walk away, or is it some other message I'm supposed to be inferring?  The vital question of who abused Howard was brought up and then dropped (maybe it was eventually answered and I just didn't get that far?)   

So, summary, not enough clear timeline and personal background for a biographical documentary and not quite enough broad-info / professional explanation for a subject documentary either.  However, if it helps other survivors heal, close or expose, then I'll add a star for that.",Rewind

The film carefully opens the horrendous process of recognition that a caregiver undergoes and that a child endures, tries to reckon with and eventually seeks to recover from. There is a grace and restraint (perhaps to protect the watcher) which creates a bearable tension. The timing is succinct. Visually, it was engaging. But mostly it was an empowering documentary for children of abuse and their caregivers because it was honest and unashamed and allowed love and anger and an excellent therapist, for Heaven's sake.",Rewind

Dilawar's death is investigated by journalists. Dilawar was beaten and tortured in humanely by American soldiers. First, this documentary is graphic with post Mortem pictures and pictures of naked detainees. The torture at Bangram and Abu Grahib is unforgivable. It does not end there but the detainees at Guantamano Bay have been isolated, sleep deprived, humiliated, and left to go mad or commit suicides as a result. The information from torture is often wrong, false, and unreliable. Water boarding is actually tame compared to the techniques used in this documentary. You must see it to believe it and understand.

It seems that during the war between 2002 and 2006, there were a number of scandals that were arising with the detainment and torture of potential war criminals during the early to middle stages of the war. Several of the detainees had subsequently been released and were interviewed to be part of this movie, of which they were actually innocent and had not ties to criminal activities. Others died during the process, including other ones who were innocent. This caused a stir in the U.S. Congress and emphasized how ugly the war was from a completely different angle than the bloodshed and suicide bombings. Certainly defamation to the U.S. Army's character and deservedly so. Sad and very, very effective.

Alex Gibney is not afraid to follow up on some very uncomfortable occurrences and asks the right questions (people). I suspect that over the years, as more information becomes available and more people have the courage to speak out, we will learn how close we got to losing our self-esteem and democratic dignity.

5,"I'm at a real loss to describe what it's like to see this movie.  

How do I describe a movie that recounts soldiers torturing and killing innocent people in our name?  How do I convey what a loss it is to America that Habeas Corpus is a thing of the past?  That we have a military that engages in the harshest brutality, tries to cover it up, and, then, in a last craven act of cowardice, allows only the lower-echelon troops to take the fall?

I know the economy right now is bad.  (I'll have more to say on that subject in a moment.) But, PLEASE, you OWE it to yourself to see this movie before you or a loved one joins the military at this point in American history.  Because anyone joining the military right now opens themselves up to the real possiblity that they may have to perform unspeakable acts that they may not be able to live with.  And THEN you will wind up having your life RUINED with jail time and a Dishonorable Discharge when the military has you take the fall for its policies.

That's not just food for thought before making a life-changing decision.  It's a six-course MEAL!

There is no excuse for this.  I don't care if 15 nuclear bombs went off on 9/11.  This country cannot torture innocent people.  When it does, it becomes no different from any other corrupt, decadent empire that history eventually brought to its knees.

The people you will meet in this movie are unforgettable:  The Afghan family who said good-bye to a son, father and brother named Dalimar who was so proud to have a new taxi to earn a living for himself. Dalimar, who they never saw again after he was taken out of his taxi, unjustly arrested by the US military and beaten to death.

You will meet members of our military who carried out barbarism while in a fog.  Who were complimented by their superiors one day.  And then hung out to dry with prison sentences the next.  They are lost, broken people.

You will meet a former prisoner, a lucky survivor who was a British citizen.  The British government secured his release after 15 months of torture.  He documents the vicious cruelty that went on around him.  I had a course in college on the Holocaust and remember when a survivor came and spoke to us to bear witness to what had happened.  I had the same feeling listening to this man.

You will hear from legal scholars of all political stripes who condemn this behavior, with the exception of John Woo, a MONSTER who wrote worthless legal memos, twisting the Constitution to the point where it had NO meaning anymore, to try to justify this barbarism.

Looking at this powerful film 5 years after it was made, I'm struck by 2 things:  

First, I want Alex Gibney to make a SEQUEL.  Gitmo is still open.  We are still in Afghanistan.  We need to hold the government's feet to the fire until the most shameful, tragic chapter in American history since slavery can be closed.

And the second point?  This country is in an economic mess right now, mainly due to overspending on the wars which caused this nightmare of American torture of innocent civilians while an unregulated Wall Street went wild.  

GOOD!  

Because that's OUR tax money that went to this madness.  That's OUR military in OUR uniforms who did it.  It was done in OUR name, whether we voted for those who approved it or not.

And Karma has a way of catching up to violent, corrupt countries that torture innocents with impunity.  Just ask any German who remembers WWII.",Taxi to the Dark Side

The treatment of the prisoners was absolutely shameful, and technically illegal, then there was a news story that broke and exposed the atrocities the US Military was committing.

5,"This film will always come under attack from soem quarters as the topic it covers is of a political nature, however, this topic should not divide political parties and the film doesn't pander to liberal ideals by placing the blame at the feet of the Bush firmament. It makes a more general appeal to the futility, inhumanity and indefensible hypocricy of torture. The question it really poses is whether Western society has tacitly acquiesced in the notion of torture as a bulwark against terrorism. This runs deeper than the political establishment and permeates popular culture and dinner table speak. That said, the negligent incompetancy of Rumsfeld and Cheney is plainly exposed by this film and should not be excused even by the staunchest Republican, unless the wish to be open to ridicule.

Another important question raised by the film, is the future of the intelligence service and how far they should go to extract potentially vital information from suspected terrorists. You'd hope after watching this film that the obvious answer reveals itself that you should act within the parameters of the Geneva Convention. Will the lessons be learne?

5,"Before stating anything specific about the film itself, I just want to make a note of how powerful this film was for me. After viewing it, I found the information about US torture so compelling and disgusting, I spent hours upon hours researching it further, partaking in book studies, and eventually co-authoring a lengthy presentation which we took to over 100 churches in Iowa. I have now partaken in over 40 protests against torture and indefinite detention here, and when I trace all of that activity back to its roots, this film was definitely one of the biggest kick-starts.

Alex Gibney is at the helm here, a man who previously directed what I considered the best documentary I had seen at the time -""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"". Here he presents another thoroughly researched, packed-to-the-brim look at the torture of many, many men, but smartly centers it around the story of one. This man's name is Dilawar, and he was only 22 years old when he was taken away from his wife and young child. He was turned over by guards hired by the US for local security around Fire Base Salerno, then transferred to Bagram Air Base where he was brutally tortured to death in five days by US soldiers.

The film examines this through interviews with both soldiers and detainees, expanding as it moves forward to encompass many important aspects of modern torture of which people may be unaware. Amongst these is the shift in democracies to torture techniques that leave no traditionally visible scars. Are psychological torture techniques any less brutal than those utilized during the Inquisition? The answer is generally ""no"". Does torture retrieve accurate information? No. Was Dilawar's story the result of ""a few bad apples"" rather than being a systematic problem? No.

The list goes on and on, until by the film's end it would be astonishing if any sane person left the room without being outraged. It is a film that helps destroy the dark void between our own families here and the families of those abroad, who are often destroyed by the military our tax dollars fund. It is a film that demands action and I hope that if you watch it, you will get off the couch and do something about what you've seen.",Taxi to the Dark Side

In addition, the bulk of our captives are not even terrorists, and torture, regardless of what film and TV show, is not a consistently effective means of gaining information.

[it.wikipedia.org]",Taxi to the Dark Side
4,"""Taxi to the Dark Side"" is a highly insightful documentary that starts with the relatively simple incident of an Afghan taxi driver dying in custody at Bagram Army Base on December 5, 2002.  While by now we may think we know most of what we can about torture and detainee abuses in the 21st century, the movie does a highly effective and disturbing job of connecting the dots, first by connecting the abuses at Bagram, first exposed by a pair of intrepid New York Times reporters, to the abuses at Abu Ghraib.  This proves that they did not just happen in a vacuum and were systematic in function, being the result of orders coming from the very top which would override any moral qualms the soldiers might have by dehumanizing their prisoners.(In the resulting investigations, only enlisted men would be charged with crimes.)  This would also include Guantanamo Bay where prisoners have been held without trial and access to habeas corpus and lawyers which are some of the cornerstones of a free society.

It is not just the causes that interest director Alex Gibney so much but also the effects down the road.  Because prisoners are routinely tortured, any information gathered will most likely be either useless or outright lies, with grave results possible.  There is an example of friendly interrogation given by an experienced interrogator which proves how truly effective this approach would be by comparison.  In the end, a lot of people who would have been sympathetic to the United States may now be susceptible to being fanaticized and we can already see some of this happening.",Taxi to the Dark Side

<center><font size=+2 face=""Century Schoolbook""><b><u>REVIEW</u></b></font></center>
Too few have heard of Dilawar. Those who have will probably never forget him. Alex Gibney certainly will not. His latest film starts and ends with this poor innocent taxi driver who, in 2002, was taken to the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. Five days later, he was dead. Dilawar's death was the spark which ultimately led to the international awareness of what the Bush administration was doing to its detainees in the war on terror. Gibney's film, however, decides to look up the tree, not down, to discover who was really responsible for these unpleasant developments. Gibney's film is bolstered by frank and interesting interviews with some of the troops on the ground. Their remorse is clear, as is their disgust. And disgust is the right word. This is, by no means, an easy watch. The use of the appalling footage which has been generated by the recent conflicts is necessary because, if anyone is in any doubt about how morally reprehensible these tactics are, this film will make it abundantly clear.

However, this film's real strength is the structure of its attack on the tactics that are employed. Gibney demonstrates that the tactics used are hopelessly inadequate and never yield effective information. There is a cutting and brilliant comparison with the old techniques and the new where an interviewee, a former FBI interrogator, uses his old tools of interrogation ? words ? and you can feel yourself being persuaded. This is not just a polemic. It is a human story and a powerful and well-constructed argument. It should be essential viewing as what has happened at Guantanamo, Bagram and Abu Ghraib should never be forgotten. This is excellent, important film-making.",Taxi to the Dark Side
5,"Eye opening or confirming, whatever the case may be. Just goes to show you that YOUR government can and will use any means necessary to justify torture and war. Bush/Obama, Republican/Democrat, it's a dual headed one-party system of bullshit.",Taxi to the Dark Side
5,"This movie is not for ostriches... which means (unfortunately) that 90 percent of the American viewing public will never see it.

5,"Bar none, one of the most powerful documentaries out there, it dealt with the torture techniques used during interrogations of suspected terrorists, techniques that can be compared to Marquis de Sade's perverted writings, and portrayed the Bush administration as a Pontius Pilate-like figure, capable of giving ultimate punishment, yet can come out unscathed and with clean hands. How could a nation of great ideals such as America not prevent such extreme measures? or was it simply a desperate attempt to achieve false vengeance because of 9/11? At times, the images were very shocking and unwatchable, but the thing that disturbed me was the soldier's description of Abu Ghraib, it indeed has engraved my mind the most. Although the majority of the film has fearlessly exposed terrifying truths, ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" settled itself with a more allegorical ending, as a cab departs from the terrains of Afghanistan, it has reached darkness in a place we never expected it to be: The streets of America itself.",Taxi to the Dark Side

While not everything is completely new (I'm certain most people know our government is a bit corrupt), this documentary definitely sheds some insight into how far our government will go.
The editing within the documentary is very top class. The people are shown speaking, then given a nice title card that helps you learn their name and full position within the Army. Not only that, the director knows when to leave the camera sitting on there for extended periods to emphasize their pain from the situation.
The soundtrack is even pretty decent. While most documentaries try to just present their ideas, Dark Side uses from tense music for scenes of torture and slow, steady music for the moments of drama.
What else really shines in this film is how the documentary is almost set up like a story. The events being described all take place chronologically, so your thoughts never stray during the film. You learn what happened first, what continued and how the situation was resolved (sort of).
While not much of the information is really new, having all of this in a personal and tight package will definitely preserve this gray spot in our history for generations to come.

It's pretty hard to watch, but everyone should see some of the acts that are being committed in the name of freedom.  Some will just assume this is liberal media propoganda, but they include interviews from members of the bush administration, the u.s. army, survivors of GTMO bay, and the soldiers responsible for the death of the innocent taxi driver.

4,"The purpose of interrogation is to obtain information, not to murder. Perhaps some torture is necessary to obtain information, but breaking the rules (or not having good rules to begin with), abusing prisoners in cruel and unusual ways, and having fun while at it is flat-out psychologically sick. Some of the soldiers' actions remind me of the Holocaust or Zimbardo√¢¬Ä¬ôs Stanford prison experiment, as the guards were being obedient to what was instructed by the higher-ups or what was commonly done, no matter how inhumane or illegal. If a prisoner were not insane prior to the torture, he or she probably were insane afterward. We should fear revenge from the innocent whom we hurt.",Taxi to the Dark Side

What makes this documentary work is that it's not the anti-American hate fest you would expect from say a Michael Moore. Rather, it takes the more somber, tragic road.

2,"I didn't care for the cinematography as much with this one. Though, I did like to see ""the man's"" side of things after watching ""S.O.P."" 

Place people in Afghanistan, Guantanamo, or Iraq, it doesn't matter, you'll see proof of what humans are capable of inflicting upon others. I'm sure Stanley Milgram would agree.

Gibney did bring up a great point when inserting the ""24"" clip. Being a fan of ""Lost"" myself, when I think of interrogations, I think of Sayid and the methods he used during Desert Storm. Or think of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and the processes the main character faced when the show thought he was cheating. Were we really expecting the interrogations of our wartime enemies to be humane? We're so desensitized. 

Why did we trust Afghan war lords to tell us who our enemies were? We've imprisoned around 83,000 individuals during this War on Terror which began with the death of almost 3,000. It seems a little unbalanced to me. Leave the work to our soldiers on the field who can see the real terrorists threatening the lives of their comrades in arms.

Still, as awful as this may sound, I think one day the next generation will thank the soldiers for their service in the Iraqi and Afghan interrogation camps because they did prevent further terrorist activity within the U.S. We may have caught a lot of the wrong people, but I like to hope that we've caught some of the right ones as well. I guess only time will tell.",Taxi to the Dark Side

5,"It's been a long time since a film made me this enraged, this sick to my stomach, this horrified, but Taxi to the Dark Side did all that, leaving me drained and a little ashamed of some of our leaders. Beginning with the story of an unjustly imprisoned Afghan taxi driver who was killed while in American custody, Taxi expands to take a long, unflinching look at both the wave of prisoner abuse in military prisons and the issue of torture (I refuse to use the euphemism ""enhanced interrogation techniques""). The result is, to put it mildly, a difficult watch; Gibney spares the viewer nothing in his tale of the effect of abuse, from the psychological to the physical, and I can't say that some of the images and words will leave me easily. More chilling (and infuriating) is the tracing of the origins of such techniques all the way up the command chain; there's little there I wasn't aware of, but seeing morality and American ideals cast aside so easily, no matter how noble the intentions, is a sickening thing that filled me with rage. Taxi to the Dark Side isn't an easy watch, but it's an important one, and one that I wish I could force anyone who tries to justify torture or who whines about ""human rights activists"" to watch.",Taxi to the Dark Side

5,"A stunning and appalling look at how the Bush administration condoned the cruel treatment and torture of detainees in Bagram and Gitmo since 2002.  Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney won the 2007 delivers a searing, absorbing examination of the U.S. government's increased proclivity for inhumanity in the pursuit of ""evil-doers"" in the war on terror. Focusing on an innocent Afghani taxi driver named Dilawar, who was beaten to death in 2002 by American soldiers after being wrongfully imprisoned for 5 days. Gibney expands from there to take viewers back to the horrific events of 9/11 to 2008, where the Bush administration, in concert with the armed forces and intelligence communities, continue to employ brutal tactics that bend the rule of law, not to mention the Geneva convention. It's a sickening film but a necessary and educatuonal one. Several images are shown from the infamous Abu Ghraib photographs, along with Dilawar's autopsy photos. Unsettling images moreso because of what happened yet similiar to other equally clear-eyed (and equally damning) films like ""No End in Sight"", there is no forced political agenda. Gibney (who also narrates) has comments from several players in the Bush administration, as well as journalists, detainees and disgraced soldiers. - He seeks to pull apart the issue of torture and why America, knowing the limited success of such tactics, continues to use it. Perhaps most infuriating is that  more than one interviewee suggests that the actions of the last five years will have considerable impact upon the future of America's relationship with the world. Such a bloody, cocky approach to foreign relations, human rights and war-time conduct has potentially done far more damage than anyone could have predicted. Despite its clear-eyed dissection of such troubling events, especially the murder of a hapless, helpless taxi driver, feels like a cautionary tale that's come just a bit too late, just after the worst has happened. As it is, it's a stomach-turning glimpse of what might await our own soldiers and citizens in the years to come.",Taxi to the Dark Side

4,"Alex Gibney's Academy Award documentary is an astonishing and startling examination of US reaction to 9/11 and the subsequent War on Terror. At its heart is the death of an innocent taxi driver at Bagram, Afghanistan by American soldiers. Gibney uses this incident to explore the widespread use of torture by the US military, made palatable to the public by '24' and condoned by the Bush administration, who used their own definition of torture rather than what internationa law dictates. Those who carried out abuse of detainees at Bagram, Abu Ghraib and Guantanemo are hang out to dry whilst those in the Bush administration and the upper levels of the military who encouraged this abuse remain unscathed. Using a series of interviews with soldiers, human rights lawyers, British Muslims unjustly detained at Guantanemo, real documentary footage, stills of 9/11 and abuse and on screen captions of facts, 'Taxi to the Dark Side' is an important, powerful and ultimately shocking investigation of how one incident captures the essence of the War on Terror and what lies behind it.",Taxi to the Dark Side

The treatment of the prisoners was absolutely shameful, and technically illegal, then there was a news story that broke and exposed the atrocities the US Military was committing.

4,"A powerful and disturbing documentary on the plight of a young taxi driver who was taken at gunpoint by Afghani militia men working under contract for us military forces and ended up dead 5 days later after being given some of the most inhumane treatment I have heard of.

The film is a mixture of interviews with now ex members of the us military who were involved in the abuse of prisoners, statements by people like Bush and Cheney over what they are prepared to do to get these terrorists (gotta love the us v them binary) and actual documents and footage of the acts taking place.

It's hard to believe that in 2009 the centre of the supposed free world and backbone of democracy, America can be complicit in such barbaric acts with no regard to the Geneva convention or common human decency. What's even more infuriating is that like with Lyndie England the blame is targeted solely at the bottom rung of the military. You don't see any higher ups getting sacked even though it's blatantly obvious that through the deliberate ambiguity and lack of clarity given for interrogation procedures from the top brass there is an awareness of what the consequences would be.

2,"It's hard to write a review because this is an important subject matter. But I think it was a very poorly made documentary for a very important subject. It was very traumatic to watch because of how it focused on certain very violent, graphic scenes, rather than presenting the subjects as people. I wanted to learn more about the victims, their lives, rather than being force fed horrific videos. Many of the videos should come with a warning - there is a scene of an attempted suicide with graphic video involving blood, there is a very very graphic scene showing a rape happening involving a man. This to me was very concerning, I don't believe this video would have been shown if it was a woman. What does this serve, to show these very graphic videos? There are so many graphic videos online of people being killed, or tortured to the point where it is almost ""porn"" to some people and it encourages desensitization and it is very traumatic to view for people who may have experienced these things or who are sensitive. There are no warnings when you watch the film however, so I am warning you now. I would have rather read about these issues than ever watch this film. I used to work for an international tribunal on genocide and war crimes so I am no stranger to reading about horrific things but I try to understand the issues rather than have graphic imagery being forcefed to me. I did make a donation to the center after watching the film. I hope to learn more about the stories about the people involved in the film from articles or a better made film in the future that doesn't try to reduce the people to graphic scenes. It reminds me of the American version of the movie Traffic that focused on violence and divisiveness versus the British series that actually captured the stories inclusively and explained the situation better.",Welcome to Chechnya

3,"Grand filmmaking on this one. Director/writer Blerta Basholli, who also did the casting, was very much up to the task of telling story of Fahrije, her family, and the remaining people of their little village in Kosovo. This is a woman condemned to live the life of a widow without the benefit of a husband she can bury.
Following the murders of over two hundred of their people, especially the men, ithout the means to support themselves, the ""widows"" depend on a nascent woman's support group that hands out stipends every month. Still they struggle. The leader of this support group offers them a chance at independence and self-sufficiency in the form of obtaining a driver's license. But a great many of the men are  driven by what has been described as 'feudal misogyny'. Seems more like 'futile manhood', since only a pathetic excuse for a man would behave that way to anyone working so incredibly hard to keep herself and her family fed and clothed. Just as sad if not worse, is all the women who think the same. At least they aren't attacking Fahrije and other women or trying to sabotage their work.
 Terrified at the shame and negative scrutiny it will bring them, all but one refuses. Fahrije is willing to brave the disdain that will rain down on her. Yllka Gashi as Fahrije is stunning in her silence. Her eyes convey her pain, her body is upright in her determination. Every insult, injury, and disappointment has been etched into her somber face increasing the depth of her character. √áun Laj√ßi plays Haxhi, Fahrije's father in law. eventually understanding of his daughter in law's fight for survival and a better life for her kids, he conveys both the conflict between hope that his son is still alive after all these years and resignation that he will live what is left of his life not knowing. The remainder of the other Kosovar actors are exceptional in this depiction of a suppressed minority that continues to discriminate against members of its own society.
Basholli has crafted a vivid film, not only of one woman's real life struggle to put food on the table but also to transcend gender and cultural oppression and stigma. Living day-to-day in the aftermath of a genocide where death is undeniable and yet still unacknowledged, Fahrije, like her circle of friends and relatives, must learn to live with memories of their lost loved ones, as it is unlikely that any of the missing  are still alive.

3,"Hive is the best Albanian-Kosovan drama film I've ever seen.  I think it's also the only one, but it's still not bad!  Written and directed by Blerta Basholli in her directorial debut, 'Hive' tells an age old tale of war and does so in a subtle and heartfelt way.  Based on a true story, the feature ends up being an uplifting jolt for the empowerment of women, young and old!  Final Score: 7/10",Hive
4,"There is a lot of intense politicization of Kosovo from both sides that many people forget to focus on the region's social problems, such as extreme poverty and immense misogyny. Hive is a drama that lifts the veil on these issues by dealing with them head-on. On purely cinematic levels, the movie is too ordinary due to its plain cinematography, serviceable directing and a lack of any score, but it succeeds as this subtle, character-driven drama powered by a terrific central performance from Yllka Gashi.",Hive
4,"When the madness of war mercilessly tears families apart, the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, a process that can sometimes be more complicated than one might expect. So it was for the women of Kosovo in the wake of the tiny Balkan republic when it was bombarded by neighboring Serbia in 1999, a conflict that resulted in the ""disappearance"" of many of the nation's husbands and fathers, leaving their wives and mothers to carry on. But their efforts were often thwarted by a misogynistic culture that prevented them from earning a living, even despite the absence of male breadwinners in many households. Director Berta Basholli's fact-based debut feature tells the inspiring story of a group of women who defied the barriers in setting up their own company selling honey and ajvar, a relish made from red peppers and eggplants. This moving tale explores the challenges of starting a business under difficult conditions while trying to keep their families together an dealing with the grief of lost loved ones. The filmmaker hits all of the right notes with this offering, most notably in the superb performance by Yllka Gashi as the beleaguered but defiant protagonist. With world events being what they are at the moment, this outstanding release reminds us all too poignantly about what we face in the wake of these misguided catastrophes and the difficulty of coming back from them without an abundance of courage, fortitude and determination.",Hive

The technical aspects, from story telling through camera work, and all other crafts is first-class and very realistic.  Bravo to this first-time director.  Hopefully she will have a wonderful career.",Hive
4,"Hive is a sobering, very important drama that is very understated but yet incredibly effective. An Albanian-Kosovan production the film tells the true story of Fahrije who is trying to survive in the aftermath of the 1999 Kosovo War. Her husband is missing and more than likely dead and she has to figure out a way to survive with her two teenage children. They live in a small rural village where cultural prejudice is very strong. Many women have lost their husbands and yet they are not expected to work or even allowed to drive cars. It's a deeply paternalistic society that puts immense strain on the women living there. Fahrije ran a honey business with her husband but now it's not really making any money. She turns to producing ajvar, a local condiment made from peppers. Slowly, against the odds, she starts to make it work with the help of the local women. This is a gripping drama about perseverance and inner strength. Living though grief and trying to survive. Yllka Gashi is superb in the lead role, she brings tremendous humanity to her part. This is a small film, with little fanfare. But it has a very important story to tell.",Hive

Not for the faint of heart, but perhaps cathartic for abuse victims and lapsed Catholics.",Deliver Us From Evil

A documentary delving into the now known sins of the Catholic Church. Definitely informs us to a greater extent of the sinister details than 'Spotlight' and it adequately identifies the individuals in the church who participated in the outrageous cover-up. However I found the structure and presentation bland and it's focus on one paedophile priest in particular somewhat obscured the large scope of the scandal.",Deliver Us From Evil

The agony of knowing what O'Grady and the likes of him did to children is shown in the faces and the words of those families whose lives have been torn apart by this horror.
This film, in my opinion, is far more powerful than the one that won accolades at the recent Oscars, because it talks directly to those involved. I will never forget Mr Jyongo and his pain on knowing what O'Grady did to his daughter.
The fact that O'Grady is a free man now, in Ireland, is nothing short of a national disgrace - for that country, for the Catholic Church, and for all of us who fail to speak out and support those fighting against abuse. As painful as it is to watch, everyone should see this film, and then go and do something.",Deliver Us From Evil

The involvement of O'Grady in the film takes it to new, nauseating, levels and yet it still seems to avoid becoming overly-sensationalised.

5,"Deliver Us From Evil is one of those documentary films that really deserved to be made just like Citizenfour to show that the world really needs to know, even when taking a risk that'll spread some controversy. The documentary is about Oliver O'Grady's past life in how he sexually abused children and how the church doesn't do anything about it other than moving him to other churches. The film starts out a bit slow which I was a little worried at first whether the whole documentary is going to be like this, but it was really just a way for the viewers to introduce the family for what their name is, what they do, and telling the story about how they met Oliver O'Grady for the first time. It gets you a bit sucked in to their stories about how the parents met the priest at the time, and when they tell you what happened to their children, you can't help but be shocked and get disgusted at O'Grady. It goes to Oliver O'Grady's point of view to give his thoughts which I was invested, but also frustrated at the same time that something like this happens, and seeing that the church doesn't do anything to help the situation, but surprisingly make it worse is absolutely shocking. You feel really sorry for the victims and the victim's family that you really want them to go back to the time where it happened so that they could prevent it. Deliver Us From Evil is an important documentary that I'm surprised that it didn't get an award for Best Documentary Feature at the Academy Awards as I think that it deserved it.",Deliver Us From Evil

The church didn't help him either, not giving him professional help. They are dim-wits that run the church!

4,"The spellbinding power of this Oscar nominee for best documentary comes from its chilling subject matter, a notorious pedophile priest and the cover-up of his heinous acts by the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the state of California. Director Amy Berg's documentary is clear-sighted and tough-minded -- a portrait of individual criminality and institutional indifference. A study in the betrayal of trust, and the irresponsibility of authority. In addition to giving faces and voices to victims who are often anonymous, it offers an interview with a convicted ex-priest who admits his crimes without remorse. ""Deliver Us from Evil"" presents three case studies of Father O'Grady's abuse. Simply put, jaw-dropping.

In the 1970s and 80s, Father O'Grady was serving as a parish priest in several towns in Central California, where he molested children over and over again, both boys and girls, including, a 9-month-old. Filmmaker Amy Berg masterfully exposes just how deeply rooted the corruption runs. Armed with anguished testimony from the families of the abused and their lawyers, she seamlessly presents indisputable evidence that the Church knew about O'Grady's activities. The hierarchy moved him from one parish to another, simply to avoid public scandal, and to prevent destroying the careers of those in power.

Present day and walking around the streets of Dublin, O'Grady peers into a schoolyard with an interest that can only appear perverse after what's been revealed about him. He seems so removed from his crimes that he could be an actor playing the part of a pedophile ex-priest. That he agreed to appear in ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" is an indication not just of an oversized ego, but also a complete failure to comprehend of what he has actually done. Father O'Grady walks freely today in Ireland, not even registered as a sex offender. ""Deliver Us From Evil"" has already prompted legal attention in Los Angeles toward Cardinal Roger Mahoney, who allowed more than 550 priests under his jurisdiction to molest children without punishment.

Watching this documentary, and especially the interviews with O'Grady, is so much more disturbing than any piece of fiction could ever be. This is a real monster victimizing children, and it was allowed by a group that was claiming to do God's work.",Deliver Us From Evil
5,"Deliver Us From Evil is a necessary documentary that needed to be made.  The film takes a look at Father O'Grady, a priest who during the 1970's and early 1980's raped dozens of children.

Director Amy Berg crafts a solid, gripping and provoking documentary.  This is a hard film to watch and Amy Berg does a great job at uncovering this dark subject and it's a film that should be seen because of the fact priests are supposed to be trusted, and many do trusts them, and O'Grady has used his powers as a priest to get involved with his victims. This is hard to watch and there's plenty of graphic discussion about the crimes themselves, and it's not a film for everyone due to its subject. The film is heart wrenching as we see families get their lives ruined by someone they trusted. Deliver Us From Evil is a well made documentary and it is eye opening, with interviews and firsthand accounts about the crimes. In terms of a documentary, this is a must see film.  Amy Berg has crafted a fine film that exposes the lengths of the church to hide the truth. With that said, while viewing this film, I can see why many people don't trust priests.

It also shows how people have lost faith in churches of any sort because of this (and other) scandals of this type. There is no hold back on the telling of their torture or sexual misconducts imposed towards them. The filmmakers have effectively displayed the tragic lives that O'Grady's victims are still living and how they will be unable to cope with their futures without thinking of their pasts. It is also appalling how this man became a further priest for a church back in his home country of Ireland when he was deported there. One of the greatest documentaries one could ever see. Also note, O'Grady is currently in prison for possession of child porn, which I believe makes the film even more potent.",Deliver Us From Evil

A priest inserting his gentile inside 9 month old infants vagina among dozens of others and  bishops knowingly sending him to different parishes with children a shocking four times.

3,"This painfully honest look at the dirty little secret of the Catholic church is a must see for those of faith (and even those who aren't religious). Looking at the story of priest O'Grady and the lives his pedophilia has affected is heartbreaking. Luckily the makers of this film give a rounded depiction of the events and tell O'Grady's side of the story -- a man who is not a monster, but who is sick, separated from reality, who's naive actions destroyed lives. The true 'evil'  of this tale is the structure of the church and its ineptitude to handle the situation in a logical matter. Instead of taking O'Grady out of the equation, those in charge chose not to believe, not to dig and find the dirty secrets. Just like a woman finding lipstick on her husbands collar, washing it away, never wanting to dig deeper to find what she knows to be true, the church did the same. They simply moved O'Grady to another parish. At the same time, this tragedy is not completely shocking. It's happened again and again throughout history in all forms of human social organizations. All large groups do the same thing, whether it is political, financial or religious -- they become more important than the parts of which they are comprised. (And hey can you blame them? Would you want to go to jail for something your coworker did?) So like any human organization, the church is flawed in its very nature, because humans are not perfect. This tragedy raises two important issues -- a.) to not raise any human to a status holier or more pure than what it truly is (like how the victims got into the position to have this happen) and b.) we should never try to control human nature, suppressing it into an unnatural inbred state (creating O'Grady with the traditions put on Catholic priests). Religion has raised us above reality, the reality of what we really are, and that is where the problem lies. We need to never forget that we are all human, animals of a sort, run by instinct and psychology. And any organization run by us will also be so flawed.",Deliver Us From Evil

4,"Disturbing and sad doc with what is arguably one of the most uncomfortably frank conversations with a child molesting priest ever. And the interviews with the parents of one of the victims is almost too sad to watch. The film is at its strongest when it focuses on said priest and his victims, which, though a prominent part of the documentary, is sorely missed whenever not focused on. 

The interviews with the priest are something to see, though. The guy obviously suffers from some kind of mental disability that makes him unable to empathize with his victims, hence the ease in which he's able to confess to his many terrible, terrible crimes. He's very charming, and, at times, is even quite funny; he just seems like a nice guy, which makes his confessions all the more unnerving. 

Overall, pretty damn good disturbing film with one heck of a villain. Unfortunately, people like him actually exist in the world, making it all the more twisted.",Deliver Us From Evil

The film even takes us to Rome and the Vatican in a study on the awareness of this problem, and not only did the attitudes and actions of the church in Rome confirm their knowledge of the problems, but even further drove home to it's victims that they do not want to acknowledge it, but that they will do whatever it takes to make sure the public does not know of the true spectrum and size of the problem.

I don't know what's more disgusting or disturbing, Father Oliver O'Grady or the leaders within the Catholic Church who allowed him to bounce from parish to parish, knowing full-well the things he had done. It's angering to listen to O'Grady speak because, like others have pointed out, you can tell he really has no comprehension of what he's done to his victims' and their respective families. He even borders on facetious in some parts of his interviews. It's as if he thinks he merely ran over their family dog and come back, shake hands with people, and have everything be alright. When people think of evil, most of the time it's some mass-murderer in history that's the prime example. This Father O'Grady is just as repugnant of a human being as any we've seen and what makes it even worse is he doesn't even really know it. 

This film basically highlights everything that I think is wrong with the Catholic Church. From the religious rituals and requirements that have no basis in Scripture (priests having to be celibate being one of them), to the God-like view that parishioners have of the church's leaders... all of it just spells ""trouble"".",Deliver Us From Evil

This didn't deter O' Grady though who carried on under the protection of the  Catholic Church's umbrella. It seems though, that O' Grady is only the tip of the iceberg with thousands of clergy molesting cases. It's certainly opened up my eyes to what lengths the Catholic Church will go to when they need to protect their own self interests.

I remember watching Ebert & Roeper review this film back in 2006.  I wanted to see it, but since documentaries are hard to find in the theater, I had to wait until it came out on DVD.  One thing led to another and I totally forgot about the movie.

Recently, I started thinking about it again but I couldn't remember the name.  I'm glad I tracked it down because it is truly an amazing film.

I'm a Catholic and went to Catholic schools from Kindergarten through high school.  That being said, you don't have to be Catholic to watch this film.  You don't even have to be religious.

Simply put, everybody should see this movie.

For those who don't know, Deliver Us From Evil chronicles pedophile priest Oliver O' Grady.  The film soon unfolds into a decades long conspiracy by the church to cover up O 'Grady's actions.

The scary thing about this film is that you're not really sure who the bigger villain is.  Is it Father O' Grady, a priest who rapes and molests children?  Or is the true villain the Bishops and Monsignors who turned a blind eye and just moved O' Grady from parish to parish.

Possibly the most disturbing aspect of the film is that while watching Father O' Grady discuss his actions, it's hard to tell if he really believes that what he did was wrong.

He's so matter of fact and creepy, you just want to jump through the TV and strangle him.

Deliver Us From Evil is shocking in the sense of how high up the conspiracy goes.  The Pope is literally an accomplice in cases such at this.

More than anything, the one theme I came away with after watching Deliver Us From Evil is that the Church is a business, and just like everything else in the world, is wrapped up in politics more than anything else.",Deliver Us From Evil

Apparently the church's reputation is worth more than children's lives, who knew? 

One of the most angering things that I heard throughout this movie was when one of the priests victims, a woman, said that she was told by someone in the church (I can't remember who) that they thought his advances toward her were okay because she was a girl and they thought it was just normal curiosity. But if it were a boy that he abused that would have been wrong. Because it would have been a homosexual encounter by their ridiculous standards.

4,"This is a devastating, corrosive, heartbreaking and extremely revealing and surprising experience of a film. 
I expected it to be about bad men, and bad things, but I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt imagine it would go so fearlessly deep into the darkness that has ruined thousands of lives, families and that lurks in the trenches of the Catholic Church. This film will shake you to the core and evoke undeniably powerful emotions for these victims of clergy sexual abuse. It shines a light on tragic and monstrous events, and people. The main focus of the film is the priest who raped and molested innumerable children, from the ages of 3 to pre-teens, and got away with it, some members of the Catholic Church tried to keep this concealed to not send out a bad message, and several lives were tormented in the process. When he finally got caught, he served 7 years in prison and was deported to Ireland where he roams freely now. 
The film reveals him, or should I say: he reveals himself as a man who is seemingly trying to be a good man, but is possessed by a disgusting darkness that overpowers him and turns him into a complete monster who would spend most of his life thinking about, planning to and molesting or raping his victims and irreversibly ruining their entire lives and psychological stability in the process. So after such revelations, it angers one to see this monster roaming freely after causing so much irreparable damage, almost unpunished, and still protected by the church.  
But the films isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt only about this priest, who I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt even think deserves to be named, it touches on aspects of the entire Catholic Church system and how it would rather cover up such vile acts than to have its image damaged and lose credibility.  The thirst for power is stronger than the necessity of justice, truth and protection, and coming from the Church, that is truly alarming.

<i>Deliver Us From Evil</i> is a documentary that portrays the story of a Catholic priest named Oliver O'Grady who was relocated to several parishes by the Catholic Church in an attempt to cover up his rape of dozens of children in the United States during the 70's. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary, Features, unfairly losing against <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> (2006). However, justice will be served someday...

It's a literally impossible task to watch and subsequently review a documentary without letting one's personal feelings to be either totally or partially involved. This documentary does not provide mere entertaining. It essentially looks for a reaction from the audience, regardless of their religion or their atheistic beliefs. However, Amy Berg's approach to both the attrocities committed by O'Grady through the blasphemous actions of the Catholic Church leaves several things clear, facts that I will list through the following paragraphs.

First of all, Berg's treatment of the subject matter does not support the scandalous acts of Father O'Grady nor tries to relate it to the Catholic religion. I, as a very strong Catholic and believer of God and what He represents, am repulsed by the human organization the Catholic religion has been subject to. This is a very brief and modest glimpse of the reality behind the Catholic Church. Ultimately, a very obvious consequence is to blame God and Catholicism for the actions of men. After all, knowing whom to put the blame is rather easy; besides, that's not the primary point. What really matters are the motives and the promotors behind the events. Call them excuses, call them reasons, call them ""inevitable precursors"", but <i>Deliver Us From Evil</i> congregates audiences for recognizing one single moral and overall perspective: this man is a disguised demon, and the Church is its monstrous mother.

Another endless topic irremediably arises: if God exists, couldn't he prevent this from happening? Explaining the reasons of why God exists and why he could actually prevented this from happening to an atheist is like asking a snail to run. There's an interesting, yet pointless discussion board on IMDB regarding the same question. The first thing the user stated is ""and don't tell me he gave us free will"". To say such an idiotic thing is to hear what you want to hear and to be afraid of the fact that a person does NOT control his/her own life, but God does. To lack such control leads to the person's psychology to be utterly frustrated and lost in perdition. The truth is we are not the judge of the world and we do not have the capacity to decide what things should happen and what events should be prevented. There are bigger reasons seen by God in this matter that we, as humans, cannot see. Consequently, everything carries a pattern of chain reaction. Are you asking for one proof? This documentary proves it and has been nearly successfully distributed to the masses, and people are reviewing it, myself included.

Another fact is that the courage of the people is a remarkable thing to enlighten. An unstoppable consequence is the human's easily corruptible religion, in this case, the Faith in God. However, it makes you wonder why the relatives of the victims agreed to dictate their testimony and why the church refused to give an interview. It's almost insulting the noticeable way the people featured in the archive footage of this documentary is not even expert at lying! If you feel like laughing at those sequences, do NOT feel ashamed. It is the human hipocrisy and their lame attempts to cover the truth what is so ashaming... so ashaming it makes you laugh.

The final result is an eye-opener documentary masterpiece. To bring to the big screen such controversial thematic material is a rather difficult job, not to mention audacious. If this is not available in your country, try abroad. It is a story that needs to be told and disseminated. Do not let totalitarian control influence what you see, cancel censorship, accept the fact that the world is the most insane and insecure place to live in. Man has rotten it. Twisted f#cks walk freely through the streets like if nothing had happened. Share this documentary; it's a filmmaking piece worth of some hours of analysis and discussion.

In order to find solace and meaning, she enrolls in a poetry class.  The movie relies on images to express the feelings experienced by the characters, most notably those of the devastated grandmother, relying on long takes and probing shots of faces and actions.

The film mainly tells the story of an old woman who developed an interest in writing a poem in her late sixties when she was also diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and has trouble remembering the words. On the other hand, there is another story parallel to her interest in poetry: Her adolescent grandson whom she raises committed a crime in collaboration with five of his classmates. They raped one of their classmates who ended up committing suicide after six months of constant assault.

Just like love, relationships or sex poetry can't be forced, it must occur naturally, through our experiences, it serves as a guide to the human condition, which Yun is deeply struggling with.

An amazing job by the lead actor.
A gripping and powerful performance. This is a slow burner that never feel dragged out or too long. It's lovely directed and filmed and it's slowly building up to a great finale. A complex film and naturally a very poetic film and I found it very inspiring and beautiful. Human and natural, subtle but still masterful. It would be wrong to say that there are not much going on here, but it can feel that way at times.

5,"This South Korean drama, which won the Best Screenplay award at Cannes, is quite a brilliant movie. It's beautifully understated and restrained, but quite powerful and sad. In terms of films about aging, it's so much better than Michael Haneke's brilliantly acted but ultimately ugly and empty Amour. This is one of the best films about an older (mid-to-late 60s) female protagonist I've ever seen, if not the best.

The film follows a tough month in the life of Mija (Yun Junghee), a quiet woman who is just beginning to suffer from signs Alzheimer's disease. She's got a lot of issues to deal with; in addition to the onset of Alzheimer's, she takes care of her grandson, an ungrateful little monster; she works part-time taking care of an elderly stroke victim; and other problems surface which I won't mention here. In spit of it all, however, she still decides to take a 1-month adult-education class on poetry writing; her greatest ambition is to write just one good poem.

This is the first film I've seen by any of the people involved. Chang-dong Lee wrote and directed it, and his work is quietly masterful. You wonder how or if he's going to tie all the various story strands together; but trust me, he does, in subtle and unexpected ways. Most of the other South Korean films I've seen so far have been either violent thrillers or horror movies; this movie, while surprisingly dark, has more in common with neorealist cinema than with the pulpy genre-driven films South Korea is best known for. Yun Junghee plays Mija, and she is really terrific. We never quite get into the character's head, but she remains fascinating to watch, and easy to care for. I read than Junghee was a major star in Korea in the 1960s and 70s, but hadn't acted in 16 years before making this film. That's amazing, considering how natural and convincing her work here is. 

I've probably made this sound like an eat-your-vegetables type of movie, something respectable but dry. Trust me, this movie is completely absorbing and a great experience to watch. It's on Netflix Instant.",Poetry
5,"Poetry is an emotionally devastating and heartbreaking drama. I can't remember the last time a film hit me as hard as Poetry did, but I'm glad it did, because Poetry is the kind of film that makes the viewer feel alive as it explores the complex realities of life so many dramas (Including some that I raved about) sugarcoat.  It's a film that never offers easy answers to the situations the main character is put through, and how she struggles to come to terms with the terrible predicaments that turn her simple life upside down in the blink of an eye, and the film does it in a way that feels very real, which makes it such an intense experience.

The plot focuses on a 66-year-old woman named Mija who works part-time as a caregiver for an elderly man and raises her teenage grandson, who like many teenagers is lazy, doesn't really like authority, and spends a lot of his time hanging out with friends. 

During this time, she is starting to suffer from memory loss, which is starting to cause concern for doctors as it is suspected she is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. She also wants to take a poetry class to help with her memory and also as a past time, which she manages to get into, much to her delight.

One day, Mija's world is turned upside down when a girl at her grandson's school commits suicide by jumping off a bridge. Upon investigating why the girl killed herself, her diary reveals that in the months before her suicide, she was being raped repeatedly by a group of boys, which just so happens to include Mija's grandson, who shows little remorse for his horrific deed.

On top of learning of her grandson's crime, doctors confirm that she does have Alzheimer's and must come to terms with the fact that her memory is going to get progressively worse as time goes by.

On top of that, the fathers of the other boys involved with the crime are trying to settle with the dead girl's mother, so that their sons' futures are not destroyed, and they want Mija to pay her part of the settlement, which she can't afford. However, it is not only the matter of not being able to afford it, but also she struggles as to how to handle her grandson, whether or not to let him pay for his crime, or let him have his future despite destroying the life of another person.

The only distraction she has away from the complex moral dilemmas is the poetry class as she tries to figure out how to write a poem, which is the only assignment for the class during the semester, but she must figure out what poetry truly is before she can write the poem.

With her life falling apart, her grandson's future up in the air, the tremendous guilt over the dead girl and her grandson's crime, and trying to find out what poetry truly is, Mija must go on a soul-searching journey through the complexities of life and moral dilemmas.

While some may find the story has too many elements, I disagree completely. Poetry's plot takes all these elements and expertly balances them all out. Not only that, but Poetry never feels sappy, melodramatic, or cheesy because every part of it feels real and makes the viewer truly ponder what they would do when faced with so many tough life decisions (Don't think you would solve such issues so quickly, as Poetry presents them in a way that makes you think twice). Every emotion is real, every situation is down to Earth, and nothing is easy to fix. With these elements contained within the plot, Poetry is certainly not something you can forget even if you were to only see it once in your life, but it will stay with you forever.

The acting is also incredible, especially from Yun Junghee as Mija. Her performance was never anything bombastic or overwrought, but it was powerful through how she quietly conveyed her emotions. Even during the quiet scenes of reflection, she makes you believe in her performance and she commands the screen with ease. The other cast members are also top notch, even in minor roles, but Yun Junghee is the shining star in a group of greats and her performance is not something that can ever be forgotten. It's easily among the greatest film performances I've ever seen, and I've seen many great performances.

Poetry has a superb story that expertly explores complex situations, characters who are not only fleshed out, but also feel very real, amazing acting, beautiful direction, stunning visuals, terrific music, and emotions that will hit at the very core of your soul because of their tremendous impact. It's something that will make you feel alive as you travel on an emotionally complex journey with the character and feel everything that she does. You will be absorbed and you will feel everything. It's truly one of the greatest dramas not only of a generation, but it should be among the all-time greats of film history itself. It's something that you can't just watch, but it will make you feel like you are a part of the experience that it offers. No true fan of drama should ever miss out on this film, or even lovers of film as a whole and my words will never properly describe the mesmeric experience of watching Poetry. Watch it, and watch it immediately.",Poetry
4,"Death and life, dignity and humiliation, youth and old age, are weighing scales in which Lee leans back all the time. Sometimes wishing we don't forget that deep down, we are all alone, others to feel the helplessness of a disease to which no one is immune and other for falling completely in love with Yun. Poetry is a brilliant exercise that hits the target of a pure and simple feelings such as poetry, the will to live or the nature of a woman who is just looking to remember.",Poetry
4,"Wonderfully subtle, undeniably powerful.",Poetry
4,"Back in 2006-2007, I took one year of literature class. The final topic of the course was ""Poetry"", just before hitting the final exam. Before stepping into the subject, we were asked about our opinions on poetry. There was a heated argument between a classmate that claimed that poetry was gibberish, sentimental and pretentious garbage with no coherent or logical structure to convey authentic messages, but only random words put together so that they sound ""pretty"", and me. The rest of the classroom grabbed popcorn to see the word fight between us.

I remember him talking more than me. However, I was concise and expressed that poetry has the capacity to unravel the deepest emotional mysteries of the human heart, and it is through language and metaphors through which we can express ideas that conventional language cannot. Therefore, poetry can be the most meaningful and beautiful art form available for mankind.

What happened next, I never forgot. The teacher agreed with me, and kicking off his Power Point presentation, the first sentences read:

(Title) What is Poetry?
(1st Paragraph) The highest art form; an intellectual activity, not a sentimental one; a way of knowledge; a game.

The other guy hated me forever and was an inch away from kicking my ass (he was your typical American-football-team-gym-macho-bodybuilder), but that's far away from the point.

Shi reminds the purpose of such art form. With a fantastic leading performance by Jeong-hie Yun, a renowned actress with a long trajectory behind, we step into the shoes of a misunderstood woman whose life is shattered by an event bigger in size and impact than her own strength... or so it may seem. She finds confort in a poetry class, and her scope about things start to change. I still firmly believe that any artistic means of expression can shape oneself's existence, and therefore my love for films, among several other representations.

The journey she takes hits very sensitive notes. Even if not all decisions she took throughout may be approved by our moral/ethical code, the journey she starts visiting places, letting nature speak to her, appreciating the road ahead of her, talking to people and trying to unleash the wings of her ""poetess heart"" are key activities to live. It is a wake up call for audiences absorbed by external wordly pressures. The fact that the movie is directed with remarkable theatrical naturalism and gorgeous sceneries just accentuates the movie's purpose with an elegant delicacy.

Admiring God's infinite creation is my particular way of living.

5,"I hate it when I hear a movie is inspirational and then you realise it is really just an ass-kissing fest towards somebody who has done something that society deems great. Poetry is a truly inspirational film, one with a power that may change the way you look at the world. The film sees the return of actress Yun Jeong Hie, as a grandmother who joins a poetry class after she finds she is forgetting simple words. Things become complicated when her grandson is accused of raping a girl and she must raise some hush money for the victims family. It's a strong and unforgettable film that never slaps you about with how you should be feeling. The moments where the film examines poetry are enough to make you want to grab a pen and paper, or just stare at a tree. The performances are consistently amazing, capturing those heartbreaking situations without a huge song and dance.

All of the swirling aching emotions and the fixation on natural beauty are anchored in a powerful central performance from Yun Jung-hee (her first role in sixteen years) whose subtle responses to Lee's visual and emotional cues result in cinematic poetry of the most powerful kind.

4,"<strong>Poetry</strong> (Chang-dong Lee, 2010)

Note: the following review could be construed as containing spoilers, despite this not being a movie where the term ""spoiler"" would have the least bit of relevance. If you don't want to know what happens, don't read on. (But then, if you don't want to know what happens, why are you reading a review?)

The supreme irony of <em>Poetry</em>, the fifth film from novelist Chang-dong Lee (<em>Secret Sunshine</em>, <em>Oasis</em>, et al.), is revealed in a scene about halfway through the film (reprised about three-quarters of the way through). Mija (Jeong-hie Yun, one of the most popular, and beautiful, Korean actresses of the sixties and seventies), our heroine, has been taking a poetry class, and is having trouble finding inspiration. She stumbles into a reading being held by a group called Love Poetry. Suffice to say the poems-which, unlike what you'd expect to find in an American poetry reading, are a mix of original authors' works, recitations of works from famous authors, and members of the audience reading one anothers' work-are atrocious. The notes Mija is jotting down towards the poem she is supposed to write during her class are more poetic than that. 

We contrast this with a series of scenes from the class. The teacher, who the students see as a great poet (but we know from the very first flyer where Mija finds out about the class he's far more skilled at self-promotion than poetry, and his every word reinforces this), has asked the students to describe their most beautiful moment. There are three scenes like this, each of them with three of the nine students in the class. The first three are heartfelt, but shallow. When we get to the scene with the second batch, they are also heartfelt, but the stories we're told are a bit more intimate. Then we get to the last batch, and we know these three people are going to throw wide the doors to their souls and let us as deeply in as they can, because that's the way Lee has structured this sequence. And given the juxtaposition of this with the first paragraph, it should not surprise you when I tell you that when we finally get to Mija, the last of the students to speak, what she says is already laced with poetry. Don't get me wrong, all three of the stories in that last bit are well-told. But Lee understands the difference between good storytelling and poetry, and that one is possible without the other. That should be an indicator to you that, given the title of his film, Lee wasn't going to mess around with a movie that's nothing more than good storytelling.

Mija's trip to the poetry classes is not the crux of the story; in fact, it's not even the main thrust. That involves her grandson Wook (Da-Wit Lee in his first screen appearance) and five of the boy's friends. In the movie's opening shot, we see a number of small children playing along the banks of a large river. (Actually, we see much more than this, but I'm abbreviating in the service of brevity; I won't tell you why, but I will tell you to pay close attention to the sequence of shots Lee and cinematographer Hyun Seok Kim use to establish presence in the opening shot. When you get to the point in the movie where you need this info, you'll thank me.) One of them stops, noticing something coming towards him, and then the camera focuses on it; it is the body of a schoolgirl. Some of the audience I saw the film with seemed shocked at this; maybe they hadn't caught the early reviews? In any case, it is established early on that Wook and the five friends he hangs out with were directly responsible for the girl's death, and the actual plot of the film deals with the closest parents to each child-the fathers of the other five boys and Mija, who takes care of Wook after his mother got divorced and moved to the city-and their plans to buy off the mother of the dead girl in order to preserver their sons' futures. This, of course, requires money. And how is a sixty-six-year-old grandmother, whom, we're also told early on, is living on government assistance and the money she brings in from a part-time job as a caretaker to an old man who's suffered a stroke, supposed to come up with her share of the payoff money?

While the movie does have a plot, and I am willing to advance that as a good thing (though not entirely, for reasons we'll get to presently), it's pretty much unnecessary to one's enjoyment of the film, save that the events at the movie's undeniably powerful ending are linked to it. This would have been just as strong a film had it been a simple character study of Mija; her adversarial relationship to Wook (a dullard, a lump, the kind of kid who's far too lazy and stupid to get into any trouble on his own; we find out in the first scene that goes into this in any depth that Wook was, in fact, just a follower), her struggle to learn to write poetry, her interactions with the people she comes into contact with over the course of the story, including her belligerent, helpless charge and the father of one of the other boys involved. (Of that subset of characters, Mija is the only one named; the others are all referred to as [x]'s father. The one to which Mija grows potentially close is Kibum's father [<em>R Point</em>'s Nae-sang Ahn, who previously worked with Lee in <em>Oasis</em>].)

And then, on the other hand, we have the plot, which Lee sometimes doesn't quite seem to know what to do with. He drops hints every once in a while about places the plot might go, such as the tentative friendship between Mija and Kibum's father, but none of those relationships ever really go anywhere. To be fair, this is also true of what looks like it could have been a comedic adversarial relationship Mija has with one of the women who lives on her street, so it's not all plot-based. Just most of it. When you reach the film's deliberately-paced climax, you get why Lee structured some of it in the way he did, but that makes it almost more disappointing; all of what you suspected about things that are there simply to advance the plot is correct, instead of those bits being as lively, and lovely, as the others. (Contrast, for example, Bela Tarr, whose characters in <em>Werckmeister Harmonies</em> are perfect little glissandos whether they're integral or not.) Still, when you see how everything falls together, you've got to hand it to Lee; he did some great setup there. This won't be any surprise to anyone who's been paying attention, however; there's nothing in this film that isn't artfully posed. My favorite example: the conversation Mija has with the nameless, blustery hospital official folowed some minutes later with the flowers in the dead girl's mother's courtyard. Especially note we are never told during the film what pink flowers signify.

With everything I said in the last paragraph, I was going to give them film a 3.5; it's excellent, and well worth seeing, but it does have some flaws. And then we got to that final shot, which is so completely amazing that I had to bump it up to four stars. The montage is so perfect that if you haven't read this, you might not even realize it's a montage (and you get bonus points if you figure out what Lee's doing before he gets to the middle shot of the montage). And then... well, that would be telling. I said at the beginning of this review that this is a movie where the word ""spoiler"" would have little meaning, but there is one exception to that rule, and it's the final shot. I think-I hope-I've given you enough to draw your attention to all the markers you will need to puzzle it out. I don't really understand why I would need to, since to me it was obvious what Lee was up to, but listening to the conversation around me as the audience I saw it with walked out, I was struck by how much was about the ambiguity of the ending, which wasn't ambiguous at all. But like most everything else about that, it doesn't matter. It's so beautifully executed that even if you have no idea what Lee is telling you in that final scene, you still have to marvel at the cinematography. Like the rest of the movie, it is enjoyable simply as a surface ride, but if you feel the need, you can dive into it and examine all the layers of meaning it holds. I would suggest either way of viewing <em>Poetry</em> is equally rewarding. ****",Poetry
5,"This film is a subtle masterpiece. Something about the end, when the poem is finally revealed, makes everything fall into silence. It isn't fast, showy or mainstream, but delicate, silent and stabbingly sad. Nothing is said, but always suggested, and that's what makes it unmissable.",Poetry

4,"As a statement on familial matters, Poetry kicks the asses of such trashes like The Descendants out of the window. As a statement on modernity and poverty, Poetry lurks beneath the surface with a sense of bleakness. However, as a statement on patriarchy, Poetry is extraordinary, reminding me of my experience with Winter's Bones. Finally, as an existential thrust, Poetry is painful, humane and heart-wrenching. The targets are very broad, but this film has tackled every single issue in a very neat manner. A masterwork that needs wider recognition!",Poetry

Il padre dell'amico le riferisce anche che gli altri 5 genitori hanno intenzione di corrompere la madre della ragazza affinch√© non faccia parola con la polizia delle violenze subite dalla figlia e chiedono che anche Mija versi la sua parte, che per√≤ l'anziana badante non possiede.

Contemporaneamente Mija ha delle amnesie periodiche che si rivelano essere un principio di alzheimer, tuttavia questo non le impedisce di seguire corsi di composizione poetica e frequentare locali di lettura di poesie, nel vano tentativo di comporre un'opera propria che non riesce a causa della mancanza di ispirazione.

3,"Lee Chang-dong's ""Poetry"" is probably better than what I think of it right now. The film is about a woman in her 60s who starts taking a poetry class while finding out she has Alzheimer's disease. Yoon Jeong-hee in the lead role delivers a tremendously calm and composed performance! What I appreciated most about it were the little things that people in South Korea do, activities that we all do for recreation. The other two South Korean films I've seen are ""Oldboy"" and ""I Saw the Devil."" So, more than the story itself, it was far more fascinating to see the country itself. Also, there are several other subplots; incorporating them into one whole was very impressive. There is a moving (and others) badminton sequence, where nothing is spoken by Jeong-hee, but everything is said. The film does end up being somewhat clich√©d, however I don't think that is necessarily harmful in the circumstance it was shown. I am sure it isn't a great film for me; however I suspect that I did not completely comprehend it. Above all, ""Poetry"" was a pleasant experience.",Poetry

4,"For a movie that had the very real potential to be melodramatic and/or sappy, I'm glad to see that Lee Chang Dong hasn't lost his ability to create believable dramas without resorting to maudlin.  One of Lee's strengths is that he knows how to direct actors and he lets their performances speak for themselves, instead of using a musical score to guide your emotions and tell you what you should be feeling.  Because of this style, Yoon Jeong-Hee gives an absolutely incredible performance, and this is a woman who prior to this movie hadn't acted in 16 years.

4,"It is hard to put in to words, but originally when I read the synopsis of this film I was very apprehensive. An ailing woman begins to take poetry classes while her grandson is caught up in up a event that could compromise his future. I assumed that this poetry class would awaken something inside her that would equip her for this trial in life. All the while serene and beautiful images float across the screen to delicate strings. Sweet but manipulative.
Well, I have to say I was wrong. Dead wrong. 
In fact, for a film that SHOULD have been wrought with sentimentality, it was surprisingly austere. The film was adorned with very little music, and no fancy camera work. The woman's artistic journey is sincere and shows that even though you may be feeling the emotion, most people cannot translate that to the page. Oddly enough, as this woman continues to toil in her tragically poetic life, I found myself wanting to write the poetry for her. Every scene became a new stanza in my mind and I tried to make up for the protagonist's inability to capture the moment in words. Rather than create unexpected inspiration, Lee waits for understanding, which takes time. This isn't a film to rush through. It must unravel before you if you are to make any sense of her journey. They state in the film that to write poetry is to seek beauty, which I find Lee marvelously accomplishes.",Poetry

4,"""Poetry"" is one of the gentlest movies of the year, yet one of the most devastating. After Chang-dong Lee's masterful film ""Secret Sunshine"" last year, I eagerly anticipated his follow up film. Hoping it would be just as wonderful, if not more, than ""Sunshine"", I wasn't let down. The film centres around a sixty-six year old woman on the brink of Alzheimers who has recently enrolled in a poetry class. She struggles to find inspiration for her poem, but starts to notice the beauty in the finer things in life after learning of her ailment. Her life becomes increasingly more difficult after learning that her grandson, who lives with her, has committed a serious crime. Using poetry, she finds meaning in life and uses it to cope with grief and tragedy. It's a devastating film with some heavy themes, but it's one of the calmest and most beautiful films of the year. Jeong-hie Yun gives one of the best performances of the year, it's simply heartbreaking. Her monologue alone in the scene where she confesses her fondest memory in her poetry class should earn her an Oscar nomination, but sadly, AMPAS voters, for some reason, don't respond well to foreign language performances. ""Poetry"" reminds me of last year's ""Mother"". Both are South Korean dramas led by sensational female performances and both are one of the better films of their respective years. This film is criminally underseen, but I guess that makes it that much more special to the select few who have seen it. It's an emotional ride, but a satisfying one. If you have the chance to see ""Poetry"", do it. You won't be disappointed. (A)",Poetry

5,"This beautifully directed little film conjured such a sensitive subject but does not afraid to tackle it. Poetry follows a grandmother, Mija, who is suffering from dementia, discovering a poetry-writing class that inspired her to view the world in a different way. Meanwhile, she found out that her grandson has taken part in a rape of a girl at his school that led to the girl's sucide. Throughout the film, you see that Mija, an incredible performance from Jeong-hie Yun, was using poetry to partly to all the worries away from her life. Yun is emotionally stunning as a guilt-full grandmother who loves her grandson and does not want to see him go to prison. The film raises political innuendos as to the 6 boys that raped the girl will not be convicted because the police does not want to investigate and the boys need to have their future. Poetry spent a lot of time reminiscing the beauty of the world around you and it was time well spent; it gives you a better sense about the story of guilt, responsibility, love, passion, and most of all sadness. Chang-dong Lee's careful and elegant direction really gave Yun a nuanced and observant portrayal of Mija.

Poetry is a quieter and more restrained film than Secret Sunshine, which contained moments of extreme anguish and pain that were physically difficult to watch.  The performances here are more contained and subtle, yet they are extremely powerful and moving in their own right.  The protagonists performance is so emotionally complex it demands your attention and simply draws you in closer and closer over the course of the film.  As I expected there is of course a horrible tragedy around which the picture revolves, but as opposed to a more average film (say anything on this topic from Hollywood), there is essentially no attempt to explain the motives behind it.  It is simply part of the world, and this woman's life in particular.  The ending scene beautifully wraps up the film, but I was still left with a feeling less than exultation.

4,"A quiet film depicting the hopes and dreams of an elderly woman in Korea, whose lazy, disrespectful grandson lives with her. This film captured the viewer's heart with its honesty and visually poetic scenes. Almost a tone poem in its presentation, it follows Mija (Jeong-hie Yun) as she tries to find some inspiration for writing poetry. No high drama here, no wild action sequences, or clever camera angles to distract from the beauty of the story as it unfolds in a most natural way. We come to care deeply about this woman who struggles to provide a home for her grandson while digesting two events that rock her world. In the end, she does what her sense of duty demands and in so doing creates beauty out of tragedy.

The poems were carefully chosen and appropriate but somehow, I expected more of the camera work. It was good, very good but never achieved great.",Poetry
5,"A brilliant film with a deep human story. 'Poetry' even though has a slow start grabs you by the collar and keeps you with it till the end.
A film which is so emotional that you could hardly stop not to shed a tear or two. The protagonist has been performed to perfection with a perfect blend of humour throughout the film. I personally felt that the film also addressed the fact that people are so busy to earn their daily bread, they have completely forgotten the art of 'literature' and 'poems' 
Every scene in the film has a subtle meaning in the film. The character stays with you even after the credits and that is the powerful performance of the leading role in the film. The last poem summarises the film in a very unique manner which you would never find in today's mainstream films. 
The Director has done a splendid job creating such a masterpiece that is so well deserved to watch on any big screens all over the world.",Poetry
4,Once you start watching this you're done. You're going to watch the whole thing. And you'll enjoy it.,Poetry
4,"Easily the best film I've seen for some time. Not many films have a woman of 66 who has just been diagnosed with the early stage of Alzheimer's as their heroine. Lee Chang-dong's title overtly reflects the middle-aged Mija's  (Yun Jung-hee) new developed interest in poetry, attendance at a poetry-writing class and then a poetry-reading club,  in her attempts, inspired by her tutor, to write just one poem.
Her world is not beautiful. She struggles to bring up her graceless and ungrateful grandson Wook in her cramped apartment; she works as a carer for a miserly and demanding elderly stroke victim. His agonisingly poignant desire for sexual gratification and Mija's reaction to this form some of the boldest moments of the film. In the meantime the world just goes on in the background - dogs bark and traffic goes by.  It is well, mundane, rather than poetic. I don't know his early work, but one wonders if perhaps Lee Chang-dong's origins as a novelist gives him a different perspective from that of other Korean directors. If anyone doubts the seriousness of the Korean film industry they probably have not seen 'Brotherhood'; they have certainly not seen 'Poetry'.
There is very little here that in the world we now inhabit strikes the westerner as alien, although nuances in the application of the Korean judicial system might raise an eyebrow or two. And the countryside just outside Mija's city is surprisingly familiar - actually it looks a lot like the countryside where I live (although the elderly  locals of my third-worldish area of rural deprivation would by pethetically envious of the Korean country buses and their automated pass-card system), and it is this that forms the excellent first and last shots of the movie.
Perhaps the most alien element is the group of poetry-lovers - one of the poets is a slightly crude, jolly policeman in his 50s who calls Mija 'Big Sister'. For an actress of Yun Jung-hee's age to get a leading role is fairly unusual. Be glad she did - she's excellent. ""When does a 'poetic inspiration' come?"" Mija asks her open-faced, enthusiastic but not nerdy poetry tutor; ""Where must I go?"" This is a film you really, really ought to see. Everyday, simple, real, inspirational.",Poetry

4,"<strong>Poetry</strong> (Chang-dong Lee, 2010)

Note: the following review could be construed as containing spoilers, despite this not being a movie where the term ""spoiler"" would have the least bit of relevance. If you don't want to know what happens, don't read on. (But then, if you don't want to know what happens, why are you reading a review?)

The supreme irony of <em>Poetry</em>, the fifth film from novelist Chang-dong Lee (<em>Secret Sunshine</em>, <em>Oasis</em>, et al.), is revealed in a scene about halfway through the film (reprised about three-quarters of the way through). Mija (Jeong-hie Yun, one of the most popular, and beautiful, Korean actresses of the sixties and seventies), our heroine, has been taking a poetry class, and is having trouble finding inspiration. She stumbles into a reading being held by a group called Love Poetry. Suffice to say the poems-which, unlike what you'd expect to find in an American poetry reading, are a mix of original authors' works, recitations of works from famous authors, and members of the audience reading one anothers' work-are atrocious. The notes Mija is jotting down towards the poem she is supposed to write during her class are more poetic than that. 

We contrast this with a series of scenes from the class. The teacher, who the students see as a great poet (but we know from the very first flyer where Mija finds out about the class he's far more skilled at self-promotion than poetry, and his every word reinforces this), has asked the students to describe their most beautiful moment. There are three scenes like this, each of them with three of the nine students in the class. The first three are heartfelt, but shallow. When we get to the scene with the second batch, they are also heartfelt, but the stories we're told are a bit more intimate. Then we get to the last batch, and we know these three people are going to throw wide the doors to their souls and let us as deeply in as they can, because that's the way Lee has structured this sequence. And given the juxtaposition of this with the first paragraph, it should not surprise you when I tell you that when we finally get to Mija, the last of the students to speak, what she says is already laced with poetry. Don't get me wrong, all three of the stories in that last bit are well-told. But Lee understands the difference between good storytelling and poetry, and that one is possible without the other. That should be an indicator to you that, given the title of his film, Lee wasn't going to mess around with a movie that's nothing more than good storytelling.

Mija's trip to the poetry classes is not the crux of the story; in fact, it's not even the main thrust. That involves her grandson Wook (Da-Wit Lee in his first screen appearance) and five of the boy's friends. In the movie's opening shot, we see a number of small children playing along the banks of a large river. (Actually, we see much more than this, but I'm abbreviating in the service of brevity; I won't tell you why, but I will tell you to pay close attention to the sequence of shots Lee and cinematographer Hyun Seok Kim use to establish presence in the opening shot. When you get to the point in the movie where you need this info, you'll thank me.) One of them stops, noticing something coming towards him, and then the camera focuses on it; it is the body of a schoolgirl. Some of the audience I saw the film with seemed shocked at this; maybe they hadn't caught the early reviews? In any case, it is established early on that Wook and the five friends he hangs out with were directly responsible for the girl's death, and the actual plot of the film deals with the closest parents to each child-the fathers of the other five boys and Mija, who takes care of Wook after his mother got divorced and moved to the city-and their plans to buy off the mother of the dead girl in order to preserver their sons' futures. This, of course, requires money. And how is a sixty-six-year-old grandmother, whom, we're also told early on, is living on government assistance and the money she brings in from a part-time job as a caretaker to an old man who's suffered a stroke, supposed to come up with her share of the payoff money?

While the movie does have a plot, and I am willing to advance that as a good thing (though not entirely, for reasons we'll get to presently), it's pretty much unnecessary to one's enjoyment of the film, save that the events at the movie's undeniably powerful ending are linked to it. This would have been just as strong a film had it been a simple character study of Mija; her adversarial relationship to Wook (a dullard, a lump, the kind of kid who's far too lazy and stupid to get into any trouble on his own; we find out in the first scene that goes into this in any depth that Wook was, in fact, just a follower), her struggle to learn to write poetry, her interactions with the people she comes into contact with over the course of the story, including her belligerent, helpless charge and the father of one of the other boys involved. (Of that subset of characters, Mija is the only one named; the others are all referred to as [x]'s father. The one to which Mija grows potentially close is Kibum's father [<em>R Point</em>'s Nae-sang Ahn, who previously worked with Lee in <em>Oasis</em>].)

And then, on the other hand, we have the plot, which Lee sometimes doesn't quite seem to know what to do with. He drops hints every once in a while about places the plot might go, such as the tentative friendship between Mija and Kibum's father, but none of those relationships ever really go anywhere. To be fair, this is also true of what looks like it could have been a comedic adversarial relationship Mija has with one of the women who lives on her street, so it's not all plot-based. Just most of it. When you reach the film's deliberately-paced climax, you get why Lee structured some of it in the way he did, but that makes it almost more disappointing; all of what you suspected about things that are there simply to advance the plot is correct, instead of those bits being as lively, and lovely, as the others. (Contrast, for example, Bela Tarr, whose characters in <em>Werckmeister Harmonies</em> are perfect little glissandos whether they're integral or not.) Still, when you see how everything falls together, you've got to hand it to Lee; he did some great setup there. This won't be any surprise to anyone who's been paying attention, however; there's nothing in this film that isn't artfully posed. My favorite example: the conversation Mija has with the nameless, blustery hospital official folowed some minutes later with the flowers in the dead girl's mother's courtyard. Especially note we are never told during the film what pink flowers signify.

With everything I said in the last paragraph, I was going to give them film a 3.5; it's excellent, and well worth seeing, but it does have some flaws. And then we got to that final shot, which is so completely amazing that I had to bump it up to four stars. The montage is so perfect that if you haven't read this, you might not even realize it's a montage (and you get bonus points if you figure out what Lee's doing before he gets to the middle shot of the montage). And then... well, that would be telling. I said at the beginning of this review that this is a movie where the word ""spoiler"" would have little meaning, but there is one exception to that rule, and it's the final shot. I think-I hope-I've given you enough to draw your attention to all the markers you will need to puzzle it out. I don't really understand why I would need to, since to me it was obvious what Lee was up to, but listening to the conversation around me as the audience I saw it with walked out, I was struck by how much was about the ambiguity of the ending, which wasn't ambiguous at all. But like most everything else about that, it doesn't matter. It's so beautifully executed that even if you have no idea what Lee is telling you in that final scene, you still have to marvel at the cinematography. Like the rest of the movie, it is enjoyable simply as a surface ride, but if you feel the need, you can dive into it and examine all the layers of meaning it holds. I would suggest either way of viewing <em>Poetry</em> is equally rewarding. ****",Poetry
2,"Seasoned readers of the arts supplements will know the phrases ""stately"" and ""meditative"" are oft-employed critical euphemisms for long and slow, which is kind of the case here... Lee underplays the hush-up plot - asking us to buy that paying off the parents of rape victims is accepted as business as usual in latter-day Korea, engendering no dissent other than from the one woman who hears about it - to such an extent that any narrative tension just drains out of the film. Miya's plight fits the mould of grim arthouse suffering (submitting to the sexual advances of the palsied man she cares for, in one of those excruciating Bad Sex scenes films of a particular inclination are prone to) and cues an admirably, in places touchingly masochistic display from veteran actress Yun, who came out of retirement to describe a woman striving to develop an eye for beauty before her tools of self-expression are lost forever; still, it gets choked up on its own florid couplets, and whole, unrewarding sections of it just don't scan.",Poetry

""Poetry is the rhythmical creation of beauty in words."" - Edgar Allen Poe

Writing is tough. You always start with a blank page. It stares at you asking for answers and it is up to you to provide them. Words are words but you arrange them to create lyricism and meaning that describes you. Ah, the blank page. The greatest impassive look, so empty with suggestions. How do I write and what is poetry? What makes good poetry and bad poetry? Such writings come from memories, sensations, experience, and sensory perception. But how do I guide my poetic voice to others? Yes, writing is tough. I'm battling with it right now.

So prompts the greatest struggle in Lee Chang-dong's Poetry, a film about a fading imagination to a world that seems to be losing its rhythm and beauty. It focuses on the anguishing Yang Mija (Yoon Jeong-hee) who is at the moment in her life when defeat and forgetfulness is the only route. She's passive sixty-something woman whose inability to identify her age is as mentally alarming as it is a devaluation of her individuality. Mija is starting to forget, and with that she loses grasp of who she is and what she constitutes. This should be a sad film but it is held up by the promising high spirits of writing. Recording thoughts, though they may no longer be there.

The story centres on an event that is devoid of beauty: a suicide. The first shot, its own paradox, is of a beautiful landscape with a peaceful river, birds flying, and sun radiating for miles. Suddenly a dead girl floats down the river, poisoning the allure of the opening image. That is the crux of Chang-dong's Poetry. This is a film desperately in the search of enchantment and inspiration but it is denied by the cold things that mysteriously encompass the earth.

Mija's later life is in search for not reason but emotion. A response. She encounters several urgent events but is never devoted to him. Her life is set to sleepwalk, with her unwilling to deal with the big problems of life but her own personal ones. She is on a quest for internal liberty but it is constantly curbed by circumstances around her.

She takes care of her indolent grandson, a schoolboy who he and his friends were responsible for the raping of the suicide victim. To cope with this crisis, the fathers of these boys use Mija to bribe the victim's grieving but pliable mother. According to the fathers, Mija is the perfect scapegoat because women are great objects of pity. They could convince a stone wall to shed some sympathy. Meanwhile she also tends to a terminally ill old man who convinces the emotionally fragile Mija to arouse him with something - well - pleasurable. Mija is struggling under the indignity of men, so how could she ever perceive the world appealingly?

Mija joins a poetry workshop where the teacher states that the class must write a poem before the end of the course. So Mija tries. With her life collapsing before her, she tries to rectify the imagination of dying memories. She wanders in the forest, admiring the landscape but without being able to describe it. Mija looks at an apricot, its texture an ambiguity to her mind. So she writes: ""the apricot throws itself to the ground. It is crushed and tramped for its next life."" This is not necessarily bad poetry, just ridden with despair and woe spawned by Mija's genuine feelings. Poetry in Poetry is so important because it is the only hint to the inner workings and remaining thoughts that linger in the enigmatic Mija.

This is a very moving film. Poignant, rich, inventive, sad, and - at odd times - happy. The best example of such bliss is when Mija does karaoke to a New Age Korean song, sharing a moment of manufactured joy. Mija has little real joy left; diagnosed with Alzheimer's she is infected with denial and starts to approach life with a helpless impassivity. It's as if she no longer cares. Thanks to Jeong-hee's excellent and effortless performance she tells us that Mija in fact does care but those emotions are buried under fear and regret. LIke the poetic imagery enshrouded in her subconscious.

I will note it took me 120 of the film's 139 minutes to realize I liked poetry. A lot. I think that is because Chang-dong is not interested in providing answers to his story, so it takes awhile to realize that. That's the point of poetry anyway. As Scottish poet Douglas Dunn said: ""you cannot expect its audience to understand all the nuances."" That is true with the film Poetry. It denies answers and covers everything in bold enigmas. Very little is answered, yet so much is implied.

Mija's story is a poem ridden with emptiness and languor. It is a portrait of her, the dead expressions that move about wearily on her face. It is hard to describe how good Jeong-hee is here. She even saves certain moments when Chang-dong's direction is overly sterile, symbolic, and blas√©. The film has its moments when certain reactions are missing or nothing enough is conveyed, which may be to engage our perplexities but instead left me frustrated.

But the film has a magic to it. It is quiet, small, and superb. The last moments of the film act like dying thoughts. But not who you think they would be from. I admit this sequence felt a little mawkish but the film deserves some sentimentality. This is because Poetry is a very detached film but ridden with moments of artistic energy and engaging introverted conflict.

Poetry does more than just work because of Jeong-hee, the lonely enigma. Being a Korean icon of the 1960s and 1970s, she has not starred in a role since 1994 in Manmubang. Jeong-hee says this role is much different to her previous performances and, while not in touch with her career, I could see why. This is a quiet, gentle performance but sharp around every complex edge. The Korean actress's greatest challenge is to embody a women who sees sadness but believes in beauty. Now that would make for an interesting poem.",Poetry

Who is Lee Chang-dong and what is Poetry? The first is a rhapsoidos, a narrator, the second is a drama ""aggressive, irritating, pungent"" In short, the worst. And 'the fruit of his narrative. And not only. Poetry is also a complex web of psychological intimacy real, tangible, visible, and it is the latter \ visibility and attempting to ""influence"" the viewer straining his self-control. But, good storyteller knows the rhythms of pathos, it is wise in the use of visual dynamism and its natural ""separator"" the balmy rest. ""Bold"" and ""italic"" alternate film, the equilibrium is reached. Even the audience is no less, the initial idiosyncrasy is deliberately demolished. Curiosity is a lot and that's enough. And the ""poetry""? How our director has used poetry to teach us ""to see what is around us?"", ""To be able to find the beauty in everyday life?"", ""Understand that it is in our Heart, Poetry?"" That the moment ""to take flight"" has come? I understand that the carriers are essentially two. The excellent interpretation of the myth Korean Yu Junghee \ Mija / (away from the set for many years and not at all withered in form and substance) and screenplay. Winning both in Europe and Asia.
Mija is an old lady with an initial decline of intellectual functions. Visited in a hospital tells of the occasional loss of memory. Subsequent laboratory tests confirmed the dismal prognosis of Alzheimer's disease. "" Takes care of an elderly disabled person and his nephew. The discovery of the body of a young high school student committed suicide, the involvement of his nephew, his silences, the easy-going projects of a pseudo committee formed by the parents of young offenders, a school administrator from the soul buggy, and the interview with the mother of the girl, ( the disease at this meeting will play a key role), Mija will to engage in conduct perceived as ""crazy."" His decisions and his actions deserve, instead, respect and study. I think.
He attended a course for aspiring poets. Poetry is his new demoiselle d'honneur, and that's how our Calliope separates slowly and inexorably, by a ""civilization"" in which, by now far away. Poetry is, for our protagonist, a ""bridge"" to new spaces of time and a warning for Humanity guiltily silent. A bridge, like the one above the great river Han. A river, the Han, who does not judge the disease or better, the torments of the soul. Indeed, these weeping souls, welcomes the bodies.

Let us listen to the Han. It is the Messenger of Love.

You feel very lonely?
The sky becomes red at sunset?

There, where you are, you can receive the letter that I've never written?
You can listen to the confession that I've never done?

E 'high time for goodbyes
Like the wind that lingers and then leaves
As the shadows
Love has remained secret until the last ...

... grass caressing my ankles tired
And the little light footsteps following me
It 'time to say goodbye
Now that the darkness is coming
It is still light a candle
I pray
Because no
Should no longer shed tears of sorrow
Why you'll finally know
How deep was my love for you
The long waits in the hot summer days
The old trail that reminded me of my father's face
And even the chrysanthemum
So that
Turns away
How deeply you loved
And how my heart beat
When I heard your sweet song
I give you my blessing
Before crossing the great black river
As the last breath left in my soul
Once again, I relive my dream
A sunny morning was closed
And when you wake up blinded by the light
Always find you
There
By my side.

In che modo il nostro regista ha utilizzato la poesia per insegnarci ""a vedere ci√≤ che ci circonda?""; ""a saper ricercare la bellezza nella vita quotidiana?""; ""a capire che √® nel nostro Cuore, la Poesia?""; che il momento ""di prendere il volo"" √® giunto? Mi par di capire, che gli elementi portanti sono essenzialmente due. L'ottima interpretazione del mito coreano Yu Junghee \Mija/ (lontana dal set da moltissimi anni e per niente avvizzita in forma e sostanza) e la sceneggiatura. Entrambi pluripremiati in Europa ed in Asia.
Mija, √® un'anziana signora con iniziale decadimento delle funzioni intellettive. Recatasi presso una struttura ospedaliera racconta di  occasionali perdite di memoria. Le successive indagini di laboratorio confermano l'infausta prognosi ""morbo di Alzheimer"".  Accudisce un anziano disabile ed il nipote. Il ritrovamento del corpo di una giovanissima liceale suicida, il coinvolgimento del nipote, i suoi silenzi; gli accomodanti progetti di uno pseudo comitato formato dai genitori degli adolescenti colpevoli; un dirigente scolastico dall'animo bacato; il colloquio con la mamma della ragazza, (la malattia in questo incontro  giocher√† un ruolo fondamentale), porteranno Mija ad assumere comportamenti percepiti come ""stravaganti"". Le sue decisioni ed il suo operato meritano, invece, rispetto e studio. Io credo. 
Frequenta un corso per aspiranti poeti. La Poesia √® la sua nuova demoiselle d'honneur, ed √® cos√¨ che la nostra Calliope si separa lentamente ed inesorabilmente, da una ""civilt√†"" che vede, ormai lontana.  La Poesia, √®, per la nostra protagonista, un ""Ponte"" verso nuovi spazi temporali ed un monito per una Umanit√† colpevolmente silente. Un ponte, come quello che sovrasta il grande fiume Han. Un fiume, l'Han, che non giudica le malattie o meglio, gli strazi dell'animo. Anzi, di queste piangenti anime, accoglie i corpi.

 
Ascoltiamolo, l'Han. E' Messaggero d'Amore.
 
Canzone per Agunes
 
Ti senti molto sola?
Il cielo diventa sempre rosso al tramonto?
Senti ancora cantare gli uccelli che volano verso il bosco?
L√¨, dove sei, puoi ricevere la lettera che io non ti ho mai scritto?
Puoi ascoltare la confessione che non ti ho mai fatto?
Le rose continuano ad appassire col trascorrere del tempo?
E' giunto ormai il momento degli addii
Come il vento che indugia e poi se ne va
Come le ombre
L'amore √® rimasto segreto fino all'ultimo...

...All'erba che accarezza le mie caviglie stanche
E i piccoli passi leggeri che mi seguono
E' giunto il momento di dire addio
Ora che sta per arrivare l'oscurit√†
Si accender√† ancora una candela
Io prego
Perch√© nessuno
Debba pi√π versare lacrime di dolore
Perch√© tu possa finalmente sapere
Quanto profondo era il mio amore per te
Le lunghe attese nelle calde giornate d'estate
Il vecchio sentiero che mi ricordava il volto di mio padre
E persino il crisantemo
Che timido
Si gira dall'altra parte
Quanto profondamente vi amavo
E come batteva il mio cuore
Quando sentivo il tuo dolce canto
Io vi do la mia benedizione
Prima di attraversare il grande fiume nero
Come ultimo respiro rimasto alla mia anima
Ancora una volta rivivo il mio sogno
Un mattino era chiuso pieno di sole
E al risveglio accecata dalla luce
Ritrovo sempre te
L√¨
Al mio fianco.

The tempo of the film is slow & I felt little bored basically because I'm not used to these kind of films. It's brave , thought provoking & gently condemns the society we live in.",Poetry
4,"Dir : Lee Chang Dong
Cast : Yoon Jeong Hee, Kim Hee Ra, Ahn Nae Sang, Lee David, Kim Yong Taek

Bagaimana seorang Lee Chang Dong, salah satu sutradara kenamaan Korea, memberikan gambaran tentang seorang wanita tua yang kesepian berusaha mengisi hidup demi menghabiskan sisa hidupnya?. Mengambil kelas untuk belajar menulis puisi, sungguh unik memang. Atau apakah memang begitu kehidupan para lansia di Korea?. Terlepas dari itu, seorang lansia belajar menulis puisi adalah sebuah ide cerita yang sangat menarik, bahkan justru berbeda dan belum pernah ada. Lee Chang Dong berhasil membawa premis menarik ini menjadi salah satu film terbaik sepanjang 2010.

Bagaimana pribadi seorang manusia menghadapi beratnya hidup seorang diri dalam kesendirian dan kesepian selalu menarik bagi Dong untuk dieksplorasi. Jika dalam Secret Sunshine, kesepian dibalut dengan pertentangan mempertanyakan keberadaan Tuhan dan kebaikannya, dalam film terbarunya ini, Dong mencoba membawa kita pada kisah kesendirian yang lebih dalam lagi, mencoba melihat para lansia memberi arti pada hidupnya. Selain tema yang hampir mirip, Secret Sunshie dan Poetry juga memiliki kemiripan pada beberapa detail film, seperti karakter utama perempuan, latar belakang kejadian pada sebuah kota kecil, dan nyaris tidak ada musik yang mengisi film ini, memperlihatkan Dong adalah sutradara cukup berhasil membentuk identitas pada film-filmnya. 

Yang (Yoon Jeong Hee) seorang perempuan berusia lanjut hidup berdua dengan cucunya (Lee David), berbekal kenangan masa lalu, Yang menghabiskan masa tuanya dengan belajar menulis puisi pada sebuah pusat kebudayaan, selain itu Yang juga melakukan pekerjaan mengurus keseharian seorang laki-laki tua (Kim Hee Ra) yang sakit-sakit

Saat baru saja selesai memeriksa kesehatannya di sebuah rumah sakit, Yang dikagetkan dengan berita tragis seorang perempuan muda yang membunuh dirinya. Kisah tragis ini kemudian mempengaruhi jalan hidup Yang dan cucunya, karena tidak berselang lama dari kejadian tersebut, Yang harus menerima kenyataan bahwa cucunya memiliki hubungan dengan kisah tragis gadis muda tersebut. Berawal dari pertemuannya dengan salah satu orang tua teman cucunya, jalan hidup Yang tidak lagi sama, karena tahap berikutnya Yang harus berpikir dan berusaha untuk menyelamatkan masa depan cucunya. Dilema berat bagi Yang, karena hubungan dengan sang cucu juga tidaklah dekat, sementara itu menghasilkan tulisan puisi adalah target utama lain dalam hidupnya. Kedua plot ini menjadi jalinan kisah hidup Yang selanjutnya.

Film ini membawa kita masuk ke dalam dunia pikiran-pikiran Yang yang kesepian, sendiri dan nelangsa. Yang mencoba untuk membangun hubungan lebih baik dengan cucunya yang pada beberapa adegan terlihat bersikap kurang berterima kasih pada neneknya. Yang mengunjungi berbagai kegiatan yang berhubungan dengan puisi, namun sayangnya kegiatan ini ditampilkan agak berlebihan oleh Dong, sehingga bagian cerita lain yang sebenarnya cukup menarik untuk dikembangkan jadi terasa datar. Misalnya adegan Yang berkumpul dengan para orang tua teman dari cucunya untuk bersama memecahkan masalah bagaimana menutupi keterlibatan anak-anak mereka dari kematian gadis yang menjadi opening film ini. Tentu isu kriminal berat ini bisa menjadi sub-plot kuat yang menopang keseluruhan jalan cerita film ini.

Tetapi Dong seperti memang hanya ingin menyoroti kehidupan Yang secara keseluruhan, membantunya untuk bisa menemukan inspirasi besarnya untuk menulis sebuah puisi. Dan Yang memang berhasil didorong menemukan ide itu dari tragedi yang melibatkan cucunya tersebut. Sebuah puisi menyentuh bermakna indah tentang kesendirian, kesepian mendalam dan tragedi yang memilukan karya Yang menjadi ending film ini.

Film ini menjadi salah official selection Cannes 2010 untuk Palm D√¢(TM)Or dan berhasil membawa pulang penulisan skenario terbaik. Kesuksesan dalam Cannes diikuti dengan menjadi film terbaik dalam Blue Dragon Film Awards dan Korean Film Awards 2010.",Poetry

3,"In ""Poetry,"" Mija(Jeong-hie Yun) is a 66 year-old grandmother who lives with her good-for-nothing teenaged grandson, Jongwook(Da-wit Lee), in a small city while his mother lives in Busan.  Mija goes to the hospital because her arms are tingly and also reports that she has been forgetting words.  The doctor is more concerned with her memory loss and recommends a complete check-up at a hospital in Seoul.  With little else to occupy her life outside of taking care of Kang(Hira Kim), an elderly invalid, and her grandson, she signs up for a poetry class where the students are assigned to write a poem for the class.  So, she definitely has time to meet some of the fathers of Jongwook's friends...

On the surace, ""Poetry"" is about the attempt to write a single poem which may seem like a slight subject for a feature film, but as the movie makes clear in its own leisurely way, creation is much harder than a single act of destruction.  And this is a task made harder as Mija is in the process of losing the words necessary to express herself.  For the record, poetry really is not about how you see the world(which changes for Mija throughout the movie, even as people always see her in the same way) and pretty flowers.  It's about emotion.  

The one thing that troubles me about ""Poetry"" is the possible blame laid at Mija's feet for her grandson's behavior since she seems to have little control over him, and therefore inferring that Jongwook badly needs a man in his life.  However, his friends, who all seem to be from wealthier families, have fathers who are present in their lives.  And since the movie is told entirely from Mija's perspective(she is almost never absent from the frame), we never find out if Jongwook is ring leader or just along for the ride.",Poetry

5,Absorbing and beautifully told story of a poor elderly woman in the hinterlands who finds poetry when she really needs it. Why don't Americans make movies this beautiful any more?,Poetry
3,"Mija is a 66-year-old woman living in a small South Korean town. To supplement her welfare checks, she has a part time job caring for an old man who I'm guessing is a stroke victim based on the way that one side of his mouth droops.  

Mija's divorced daughter works in a distant city, leaving Mija to care for her 16-year-old grandson, Wook.  Though, presumably, children in Asian cultures are taught to respect their elders, Wook is a notable exception. The only time he willingly speaks to his grandmother is to demand that she make him something to eat.  Any attempts on her part to engage him in conversation are rudely rebuffed.

Mija was just diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's.  So far, her only symptom is that she occasionally forgets basic words, like ""wallet"", ""bleach"", and ""terminal"". The doctor tells her that nouns are the first to go, followed by verbs. No mention of adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions, but I suppose once the nouns and verbs go, there's nothing left to modify or connect.

One day, Mija happens to see a flyer for a poetry class and, having always felt she had the soul of a poet, she signs up. Her teacher does little more than talk about finding inspiration - he tells the class to really SEE the apple he's holding - and suggests that they carry around notebooks to write down inspirational thoughts they can use to make poetry.

Mija stares intently at fruit, trees, and flowers, and regularly scribbles in her notebook, yet she struggles to find anything that really inspires her.  She sticks with it even when tragedy strikes - a teenage girl commits suicide and the girl's diary indicates that prior crimes by Wook and his five friends make them at least partially responsible. 

Mija learns this from the other boys' fathers, who invite her to a lunch meeting at which they discuss how much money they should pay the girl's mother, a poor farmer, to keep her from going to the police. The fathers act as if this is nothing more than an unfortunate business expense and toast their decision over beer. Mija wanders outside to look at the flowers.

Though Mija is very upset by what she's learned, she says very little about it, even to Wook, who ignores her anyway. She has no way to come up with her share of the money - about $4400 - but clearly she finds the moral aspects of the situation even more troubling.

Based on the outstanding reviews this film has received by ""real"" critics, I feel like it's almost a personal shortcoming that I didn't really appreciate it more. The ending was quite confusing; I had a little confab with some strangers in the lobby afterwards to try to sort it out. But it wasn't just that - part of the problem was all of the poetry!

The movie is filled with it and I just don't get it - just ask my freshman year English teacher who almost failed me for my inability, or perhaps refusal, to embrace poetry's inherent imagery and symbolism. Writing a ten page essay about a ten line poem just seemed so contrived. Sometimes an apple is just an apple, damn it!

Mija attends several poetry readings and I honestly don't know if the poems we hear are supposed to be good or bad. She certainly seems impressed, but if what she's listening to is actually crap and the ""poets"" she idolizes are just a bunch of hacks, it totally changes the nature of her struggle. 

I loved the character of Mija, but she's really quite an enigma, especially considering the Alzheimer's diagnosis. It was often hard to know just what was going through her head when she did something. When she leaves the lunch meeting to look at the flowers, is it to escape the horror of the conversation, because she's a generally flighty person, or because she's losing her grip on reality?

Several characters comment on her clothes - flouncy sun hats and vivid colors -- which look fine to me, but I don't know what older Korean women normally wear. Is she meant to be an eccentric? The younger adults she comes in contact with all seem to either ignore her or subtly sneer at her. She's only 66 and looks great - hardly a doddering old fool - so I was somewhat perplexed by the way people seemed to be treating her. 

I liked parts of this movie a lot, but overall, I didn't really get it. I was almost always one step behind, trying to figure out things that didn't quite sit right in the previous scene. I wanted to love this film, but I guess I just don't have it in me. I'm a thinker more than a feeler.  I majored in Math, not in English. 

This movie was either over my head or under my head or on a completely different plane running parallel to my head. I suppose I could just join the chorus of raves and pretend that I loved it, but my unwillingness to pretend is what almost caused me to fail freshman English - and after all these years, I'm sticking with it.",Poetry
3,"I really wanted to like this more than I did. A great deal of the movie is very, very good but it is ultimately undermined by pacing which is a little too slow, scenes that last a little too long, and themes that are repeated a little too often.",Poetry
4,Jeong-hie Yun fills my heart with flowers.,Poetry
2,"""Poetry,"" the new film from South Korea's Lee Chang-dong, should have been wonderful, but it is destroyed by a terrible editing job. Almost every scene is five times longer than necessary, creating a maddening feeling of languor, and extraneous material also clouds the focus of the film. There is a masterful, melancholy film somewhere deep inside the 100 or so hours that Mr. Lee shot for this project. But the editor had no idea how to whittle down the footage to find that film.

Bad editing is so common nowadays. Yet prominent critics never complain about it. We will only get better editing if we start demanding it. If critics remain silent, filmmakers will never know that there is a problem. This gives me a feeling of doom because there is no sign that top critics have noticed all the weak editing on movie screens today.

""Poetry"" tells the story of a lower-middle-class, semi-educated grandmother who's been discarded by just about everybody in her life. Her teenage grandson has been left in her care in a tiny one-bedroom apartment for reasons that aren't explained. She tries to provide parenting, but the boy basically ignores her - just like everyone else does. Yun Jeong-hie, who was a big star in the 1970s, plays the grandmother in a gentle, slightly over-sweet way.

This lonely old woman has two main things going on in her life. She is taking a poetry class for the first time, trying to see life in new ways so that she can write her first poem. She has also just received news that her self-absorbed grandson has committed a horrific crime. She is given the opportunity to sweep the crime under the rug if she can come up with a huge sum of money. Even if she does decide to do this, there is the problem of coming up with the money. She is juggling several huge dilemmas when what she really wants to do is write a poem about birds, trees and flowers. One scene captures her denial particularly well. When she is first told about the crime, she goes into something like catatonic shock. Then she silently gets up right in the middle of the meeting when people are speaking, walks outside, and starts marveling at the flowers.

Struggles with denial, aging, loneliness, grand-parenting, and learning to see life in new ways toward the end of one's life is terrific subject matter. But it's almost too much. When a movie is in so many places, it's especially urgent that the editor know what he's doing. Sadly, that was not the case here. What we end up with is something like a rough draft of a masterful film, more than a finished product. Maybe in 10 years a brash young filmmaker can remake this film and do a better job. This is one film that is worth remaking.",Poetry
4,"This riveting, delicate and exquisite Korean drama from Lee Chang-dong (Secret Sunshine) begins with the image of a body floating downriver, that of a raped schoolgirl who has killed herself. At the same time, a pensioner (Korean star Yun Jung-hee, a beloved Korean actress) is raising her teen grandson, who is implicated in the girl's death. The older woman, facing an Alzheimer's diagnosis, enrolls herself in a poetry class, eager and desperate to find the words to describe all the beautiful things she has know before her mind fails her. The movie does her one better, making her very life a beautiful poem on what it means to live fully and really see the world.",Poetry

Yun, something of a national treasure in South Korea, came out of retirement to play Mija.  She gives a rich and complex performance.

Poetry is definitely not for an average movie viewer, who maybe is looking for something entertaining. It was more an exploration of difficult human conditions that people might find a bit boring. But  Poetry was meaningful and deep in its own way. It presented life realistically, and also some positive ways for finding relief within the worst conditions, in this case, the old lady looked for learning poetry. It can be misunderstood by some viewers but it is surely a movie that required effort to think and understand the movie for what it is. Once you can appreciate the purpose if it, it will become a wonderful movie for what it's worth. I was speechless.",Poetry
4,"Beautifully made from director of Oasis.He has tried to create a real and tangible atmosphere about the modern life's social disorders.The main story shows us the bitter side of machinery life and at the same time, connection of the creativity in writing poem with tasting the bitterness of life.It's one of those movies which leaves you with an unusual feeling. After watching it you feel that it hasn't finished yet and you're going to live with that for days.
Movie tries to say what the modern society and machinery life has brought up is the youth's depression, sexual disorders, material life and destruction of morality. New generation seems more frustrated than older ones.There is a gap between the generations in this society whose bitter side is more inspiring for writing poem than it's hidden beauty .The forced bitterness and disorders that makes our passionate feeling about discovering the nature's beauty unreal.",Poetry

Overall, they get a brief reprieve from their world and get a glimpse of art and some attention from the art world. This has a high potential for exploitation, but that wasn't the feeling I was left with.  The workers themselves were already rights-oriented and they seemed even more empowered by the experience. They seemed happy to be involved in the project, and of course, it looked hard for them that it couldn't last for long; but the overall message was positive.  And the art is pretty impressive.

He leads them into his world of art as they continue to rummage through the rubbish gathering thought provoking portraits of their lives.

4,"Interesting Oscar-nominated documentary from 2011. A successful Brazilian artist returns home and heads to the largest landfill in the world to complete a project with the workers who sift through the garbage to find recyclable material.

It's an odd feeling seeing these people. Some seem happy, and it is honest work and they probably do not know better. At the same time, they spend all their time either digging in trash or living in it. Very miserable conditions. Vik comes in and shows some how unhappy they are. And some of these could be very good people in another world. But he takes a handful of them and makes art with them and transforms their lives.

The art itself is a little mindblowing. Vik takes regular black and white photos, makes them huge and projects them onto a floor where the workers can place garbage to recreate the photos. A photo is taken and that is the photo that is sold...trash making up a photo of the trash pickers. It makes sense when it's large, but in photo form, it's just hard to imagine the scale of the original work. 

Did not know it was Oscar nominated while I watched it. Thought it was good but not necessarily great. Glad to see it got some attention however because sticking up for workers is always good, and art is usually good.",Waste Land

4,Very interesting documentary highlighting the poverty in Brazil.,Waste Land
5,"From the sky, from above, Jardim Gramacho seems as gruesome as you would think the largest garbage dump of the world would seem. But if you take closer look, if you take a walk around the place and stand the smell of tons of waste, if you talk with the ""catadores"", the people working there picking up recyclable material, you realize that this place is much more than a large, open-sky dumpster. It is a working place, just as any other. Its dynamic is the same you would probably find in an office at downtown. The job the ""catadores"" have to carry on is not a pleasant one, of course, but the majority of them are just proud of being there, instead of being involved with drugs or prostitution.
The power of this movie is in its characters. First, we learn about Vik Muniz and how he became the best-selling Brasilian artist in the world. But then, he steps aside and starts involving lovable characters (some of the ""catadores"") in his project, transforming their lives in the process. Among the litter, among the trash we find these people. Some of them are just victims of misfortunes. But they are still standing strong, willing to change their future, to do better things for their children and their community. And their dignity, their dreams, their hopes shine althrough the desolation of Jardim Gramacho and make us comprehend how resilient the human spirit can be.",Waste Land
4,"An moving documentary highlighting the transformative power of art, and the beauty of the human spirit. Top-selling contemporary artist Vik Muniz rooted in New York decides to give back to a community where he was born and raised. He travels to Jardim Gramacho, the largest landfill in the world on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. With the intention to help the pickers to improve their lives using his art, what starts as an introduction to the devastating poverty and lack of infrastructure in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, begins to transform into a story of unrelenting spirit, strength, and inspiration. 

Perhaps director Lucy Walker initially intended to make the film about Muniz. If so, her subject led her to a better one; as he returns to Rio to photograph pickers for a series of portraits, she begins to focus on their lives. We see where they live, we meet their families, we hear their stories, we learn of the society and economy they have constructed around Jardim Gramacho, the ""Garbage Garden."" Zumbi, a member of the association, who began a library from his home from books that had been discarded, Irma, a cook who makes stews and roasts from edible meat to feed the workers, Suelem, an 18-year old girl who has been working in the garbage dump since she was only seven years old, and Valter, an elderly man who entertains with stories and songs and who decides to participate because he believes that ""it will raise awareness of all us pickers."" Once the initial photographs are made, Muniz projects an enlarged version of each photo onto the floor of his studio and hires the pickers to add refuse from the landfill onto the canvas, photographing the result from overhead. This then becomes the finished art work, ready to be exhibited at auctions and museums around the world-- with the pickers traveling to such cities as London and New York, the first time they have ever left Gramacho. (Heavily debated decision and the possible ramifications) 

Life is unpredictable that way. ""Waste Land"" is a testament that things can go from good to bad in an instant. But they can also improve just as quickly. A social documentary based around a self reliant community of people disregarded and largely ignored, who find unrealized beauty in their everyday work, modern art, and in themselves. I can never again put out my recycling bin without giving thought to how much more this film communicates than just that.",Waste Land

Mas acima de tudo, as personagens de Lixo Extraordin√É¬°rio s√É¬£o muito interessantes.
O enfoque do filme n√É¬£o √É (C) o lixo dispensado no Jardim Gramacho, mas o papel da arte de Vik Muniz na vida das pessoas que trabalham no aterro. O que mais me chamou a aten√É¬ß√É¬£o no filme foi uma discuss√É¬£o entre Vik e sua esposa, balan√É¬ßando os efeitos que a interven√É¬ß√É¬£o deles na realidade dos catadores de Gramacho e como seria a vida dessas pessoas uma vez terminado o projeto.
As lentes de Muniz capturam menos lixo e mais humanidade. S√É¬≥ o projeto j√É¬° era uma obra de arte. Sem questionar se o papel do artista ali √É (C) mais marketeiro do que transformador (porque essa foi a discuss√É¬£o entre amigos quando deixamos a sala do cinema √¢"" mas eu acho que ningu√É (C)m se dedicaria tanto tempo a um projeto s√É¬≥ por uma jogada de marketing para vender mais), a narrativa do document√É¬°rio tenta mostrar sem didatismo como o contato com a arte pode emocionar e mudar a forma de encarar a vida de quem n√É¬£o tinha contato com ela antes. √É uma hist√É¬≥ria com muitos personagens fortes e surpreendentes; s√É¬£o eles e a expectativa de ver a obra conclu√É¬≠da que d√É¬£o um outro tom ao filme.

N√É¬£o poderia deixar de ao menos mencionar que, apesar de quase todos os personagens serem brasileiros, o document√É¬°rio √É (C) falado em ingl√É¬™s e portugu√É¬™s. Por fim, Lixo Extraordin√É¬°rio ganhou v√É¬°rios pr√É¬™mios e participou de festivais internacionais em 2010, ele tamb√É (C)m foi indicado ao Oscar 2011 de melhor document√É¬°rio.",Waste Land

4,"A documentary about the international acclaimed Brazilian artist Vik Muniz, who  reconstructs photos using garbage materials from Jardim Gramacho, the world√¢(TM)s largest landfill in Rio de Janeiro, and with the help of the pickers who work and dwell there. An both artistically tantalizing and sociologically empathizing body of work.

This film has indeed reminded me that it is the one should have used the 4D gimmick which brazenly hyped by SPY KIDS: ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD IN 4D (2011). With a bit odor touch, it could enhance more on the turmoil what we are watching in the landfill, and it is an extraordinary case that the sense of smell could actually have played a more essential role in the film genre. 

Anyway, the environment-concerned stress has never been under the spotlight here, being a documentary about art and garbage pickers, one possible pitfall is the condescending inclination, but blithely it is not the case for this film, instead it spends most of time on the individual pickers who are involved in making this project, it captures many poignant moments behind their own stories. No doubt, Vik√¢(TM)s work does have a pivotal role of altering the pickers lives, but the film does not  overwhelmingly hinge on the process of making those artworks, and which perfectly encapsulates a more sublimated obligation in additional to a general aesthetic percipient, to change the world in a better way, and Vik and his team has done it, a tenacious and awe-inspiring job.

Apart from the riveting story, there are several panning scenes of the landfill are astonishing, our life is linking with garbages everyday, but most of us act like they are thoroughly vanishing from the earth after when they are being discarded in the dustbins. After watching this film, we might be coerced to face some soiled corner of our life which we are selectively and subjectively ignoring, and starts with the most basic one: behave yourself.",Waste Land

3,"As related in the documentary ""Waste Land,"" the best thing that ever happened to artist Vic Muniz was being shot when he was younger.

The pay off allowed him to go to America where he could pursue his dreams of being an artist and has succeeded by using found materials.  Now, he wants to apply the same approach in returning to his home country of Brazil to create art around the giant garbage dumps in and around Rio de Janeiro, not without a little danger from the nearby favelas.  At this point, it is not explained why his wife does not handcuff him to the radiator to prevent him from going.

But what he does find in Jardim Gramacho is a great deal of community and camaraderie amongst the thousands of recyclers, which the women prefer to the alternative of drugs and prostitution.  This inspires him to give back to the workers by making portraits(my favorite being the Marat pose), while also giving them the proceeds from the sale.

""Waste Land"" is insightful in giving us a close-up of a rarely seen part of Brazil, and at the same time through the art and publicity exposing it to the wealthy citizens of the country.  On a general note, it reminds us of how much we throw out on a daily basis and what can be recycled while also on a metaphorical note that no human being is ever disposable.  However, I think the documentary errs by bending over backwards in trying to give a positive spin to the workers' lives, despite the dangers and hard and dirty work involved.  And Muniz, whose own story takes a back seat, is to be commended for what he does, even as it is only a drop in a very large ocean.",Waste Land

But, the film kind of shut up and just let the subjects share and let the story organically evolve.

3,"Last year saw two ""Land"" documentaries nominated for Best Documentary at the Academy Awards. One was GasLand, and interesting documentary about natural gas drilling and the effects on nearby water supplies and the people affected. Waste Land is quite different. It follows renowned photographer/artist Vik Muniz, a native of Sao Paolo, Brazil. Muniz came from a poor family and never quit his dream, riding it all the way to a nice studio in Brooklyn. For his next project, Muniz decided he would travel to Rio in Brazil and document Jardim Gramacho, the world's largest landfill.

Once there, he discovers many fascinating people who work there collecting recyclable materials. Slowly the audience and Vik gets to know these people. Why they work there, where they come from, how they are able to sift through trash everyday. We meet Tiao, who is the young president of the organization that protects the landfill workers. He is young and charismatic, making sure that the work of the ""pickers"", as they are called, does not go for nothing. We meet Zumbi, the man who saves every book he comes across in the piles of rubbish, so that one day he can open a library for the pickers. We meet Suelem, 18 year old mother of two, Isis, and Irma, the cook for the lot. We meet Valter and Magna. Each of these people has a fascinating story as to why they are there and what they do.

The film speaks extremely strongly of the human spirit. These people are extremely proud of their work. Proud that they did not stoop to prostituting themselves to get by, proud that they are retrieving all of these recyclables from the waste land. Their story is heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. Meanwhile, we realize that this is also the story of Vik and his endeavor to create art by using these people and the trash they spend their lives in. He uses them to help him construct his portraits and takes them away for a time from the dump. This is an interesting move. When at first they are proud of their work, they soon come to the realization that what they do might be below them, and not something they ever want to return to. This may be the only downfall of the film, had they not had a discussion about it in the film. Vik and his collegues sit down to talk about what they are doing and, as Vik says, maybe they are doing them a favor by taking the veil from their eyes and opening up the light of opportunity to them.

Waste Land is a good documentary that does nothing more than tell the stories of a fascinating group of people who work at a trash dump in Brazil. The film would be much stronger if it was about just that, but it also has the story of Vik and his rise to prominence as an artist and his work on this particular project. At the same time it does raise some interesting questions that have to do with art, much like Exit Through the Gift Shop did last year. By the end of the film, I found myself caring deeply about these people because director Lucy Walker did such a great job of painting their stories so intricately, allowing time for each person to seep into the mind of the viewer and take hold. And for that reason, Waste Land is worth checking out, if not just to witness the ability of the human spirit.",Waste Land

Renowned artist Vik Muniz goes to the world's largest garbage landfill in Rio de Janeiro, to meet the garbage pickers who live there, hoping for inspiration for his art. He expected to find people without meaning or purpose, drug-addicted, malnourished, and helpless. What he found was the dignity of humanity displayed in the hearts, minds, and faces of these people. 

He works with them to create amazing pieces of art, using the very recycled garbage that they pick as the material for the art. As they work together to make the art, they see life beyond their garbage heap. 

Muniz sells his art at auction and gives the money back to the pickers, providing them with the means to make change for themselves and for those who make their living as pickers.

This is a very moving film, giving insight into the wonder of what God has created in His Image, the power of Art to bring hope and create change, and the desire in all of us to bring about a better world.",Waste Land

5,"World-famous artist Vik Muniz returns to his native Brazil to create works of art out of trash, assembled by the trash pickers who collect recyclables from a landfill for a living. Muniz ponders how much he can acceptably disrupt the lives of his subjects. The film is marketed as and is an uplifting story - the pickers' lives are turned upside down. The deeper question is about happiness - were they happy before Muniz entered their lives and showed them a new side of the world? How can they go back to picking after participating in a life-changing modern art project?

4,"I like watching a film about which i know nothing, not even a review. It means I can be pleasantly surprised by something. Which in this day and age of information overload is a little bit of a treat. 
And thats what Waste Land is, a treat. Vik Muniz is a Brazilian artist who goes to the dump in Rio to film and make art out of photos of a few different people. Its beautiful stuff really as he goes through the selection process to photographing them to making a big piece of art from recycled materials to the show in london and Rio. 

As other reviewers have noted it shows how art can change people. I think it also shows how people can change people. Vik shows the pickers a different life and a different way, engages them and makes them dream of a better life. There is an interesting scene where he is shown arguing with his wife and friend about whether making people dream of a better life is a good thing. He gets my vote.",Waste Land

Synopsis:  Renowned artist Vik Muniz embarks on one of the most inspired collaborations of his career, joining creative forces with Brazilian catadores -- garbage pickers who mine treasure from the trash heaps of Rio de Janeiro's Jardim Gramacho landfill.

Wasteland deals with many different subjects.  It has a faint eco-concerned message, much of it is concerned with the modern arts, it touches on the rift between social classes and a big part of it deals with the dreams of individuals. By far the biggest theme present is the value of honest labor and the pride one gets from such work. 

 The picture is not depressing or dark as the title may lead you to believe, it's an uplifting and inspirational tale that is in no way contrived, and the emotions one can wring from this picture are fabulously varied.  It's highly entertaining, philosophical, somewhat subtle, and does a good job of showing the good and the bad sides of poverty.

Through the lives and words of the people it documents, Wasteland is a fine example of inspirational cinema.",Waste Land

Ray and Carla are lovers, both cheating on their spouses, who decide to steal a satchel full of money from Carla's husband, who has hidden the bag of cash in the attic.  It all seems pretty straightforward until the plan goes horribly wrong, resulting is a nasty chain of blackmail and murder.  Despite their stupidity, the two lead characters are interesting and the film moves along at a brisk clip, keeping you guessing along the way.

4,"A dark and dank Aussie neo-noir thriller that probably won't take you to places you've never been before cinematically but still provides a solid hour-and-a-half's worth of genre thrills, provided you don't go in expecting everything to be all sunny and rosy in the end. Most film noir, by its nature, is pretty cynical and grim stuff but this one is as much a straightforward, almost Shakespearean tragedy as it is a twisty, atmospheric thriller. In someways, it is even more downbeat than another recent Australian import, 2010's Animal Kingdom, although I liked that film slightly more. Unlike this effort, that one took what could have been a garden variety crime drama in a more interesting direction and became something far more powerful as a result. On the other hand, this film is content to be your basic tale of lust, infidelity, murder and betrayal - everything that one expects from this sort of movie. It can be argued that perhaps it wears its influences on its sleeve a bit too much; in particular, I was reminded of the Coen Brother's debut Blood Simple and Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan (the fact that this involves cheating spouses brings to mind the former, while the greed and duplicity of the main characters could easily remind one of the latter). Still, it manages to infuse the material with enough freshness that it doesn't come off as a complete clone of its cinematic ancestors.

For me, one aspect of the film that keeps it from reaching its full potential is a near dearth of likable or sympathetic characters. Yes, I realize that these kind of films are usually populated with all sorts of unsavory types but in order for something like this to be truly devastating, we need to be drawn to the protagonists and emotionally invested in their plight. Unfortunately, neither of the individuals in the principal pairing, Ray (David Roberts) and Carla (a sexy Claire van der Boom) succeeded in getting me in his or her corner. Putting aside their obviously devious and conniving nature, neither of these two characters demonstrates that they are very bright (she is clearly more the manipulative of the pair but he is supposed to be a construction project manager so you'd think that he'd be better at executing plans). Every time they try to scheme or plot something, it inevitably goes horribly awry because of their carelessness and their attempts to fix their problems only exacerbate the situation until it becomes too much for anyone to handle. It would be hilarious if only it didn't turn out to be so tragic. It's pretty clear that everyone in this movie is headed on a collision course with catastrophe but despite our intellectual awareness of this, it's tough to truly feel any empathy for these people even as they're descending deeper and deeper into the personal hells that they've created for themselves.

Just because the characters aren't sympathetic, that doesn't mean they're not well-acted. As the cheating spouses, both David Roberts and Claire van der Boom give strong performances and allow us to sense their characters' desperation as they scheme to break free of the monotony that has defined their existences but find themselves in way over their heads in the process. Both understand how to deliver dialogue but where they truly shine is in their non-verbal acting. There are several scenes where the looks on their faces tell us everything we need to know. As Claire's husband Smithy, a tow truck driver who is a low-level crook on the side, and Ray's wife, Martha, both Anthony Hanes and Lucy Bell are solid but they don't threaten to take the spotlight away from the leads. Also worth mentioning is Joel Edgerton who, in addition to co-writing the screenplay with Matthew Dabner, has a significant onscreen role as Billy, the thug-for-hire whom Ray uses to help cover his and Carla's tracks and who unwittingly -and quite literally - sparks the first major tragedy of the film. In recent years, the actor has seen his profile rise on both sides of the ocean with superlative performances in films such as the aforementioned Animal Kingdom and 2011's Warrior where he played Tom Hardy's older brother. Personally, I didn't find Edgerton to be quite the standout here that he was in either of those two more recent films, but he still does a solid job in a somewhat cliched role. As Billy, he is suitably shady and menacing, which is really all that is needed of him. 

I would say that in this case, Edgerton's efforts as a writer are more noteworthy than his acting (although he clearly didn't write the most interesting character for himself to play). Again, there is nothing particularly original about the plot line but it is still well-written and Edgerton and Dabner refreshingly don't feel the need to infuse this with Hollywood cliches. Instead, they allow things to unfold the way they likely would if this were to happen in real life. I'd say that they deserve credit for not pulling any punches in steering the story to it's natural, albeit grim, conclusion. Perhaps the manner in which the movie elects to wrap things up isn't all that surprising considering everything that leads up to it, but it still packs a punch (although the lack of emotional investment with the main characters doesn't allow this blow to be as strong as it could have been). Also, in a departure from most noir thrillers, the comic relief is very limited here; in fact, I honestly can't recall anything here that could remotely be construed as even a little funny (except perhaps for a small subplot involving the canine companions of the two lovers). The potential is there for a deliciously dark Murphy's Law - type comedy but the script takes it's characters and their circumstances very seriously - perhaps too seriously. Sitting in the director's chair is Nash Edgerton, Joel's older brother (the fact that this film is the product of sibling filmmakers further strengthens the connection to Blood Simple); the elder Edgerton definitely does justice to his younger brother's script. The pacing is tight with more than enough tension and suspense to keep most viewers riveted and the proceedings are suffused with atmosphere although perhaps it's not as overwhelming here as it is in other similar efforts. In the final analysis, this film may not offer anything that's truly new and groundbreaking, but it executes it's stock elements with enough aplomb to be worth viewing for fans of noir thrillers that hit all the expected bases but don't feel the need to cheat viewers with a cop-out ending.",The Square

3,"The Square is more likely reminds me of Take Shelter but in a other way around. The story is about this guy Yale a constructor and a family guy, having an affair on this Carla and there you go. The first part of the story is a problem itself, though I've seen this kind of film before, I'm thinking it could have better deliverance, a better ending which it could have been satisfying, it just lacks charisma. A very good thriller flick to watch anyways.",The Square
2,"Not everyone can make a cohesive film, so developing a conditioned film is a feat. But there comes a point where films are being made simply for the sake of making films, serving no higher purpose. To me, The Square is such a film.",The Square
3,"This Australian film gets off to a great start.  Unfortunately, late in the picture it becomes entangled in too many twists (and racks up an unnecessarily high body count).  The revelation of this film is Claire van der Boom.  She's got IT--star quality.  After earning good reviews for this picture she came to America looking for the big Hollywood break. Hasn't happened yet, though she's got some TV work (Hawaii Five-0).  This April 2012 she'll be the lead in an Off-Broadway premier of David Rabe's play ""An Early History of Fire"".",The Square
4,"Many people have compared the Australian thriller ""The Square"" to the best of the Coen Brothers films and I believe the comparison to be valid. The film features an intricate plot that starts out simply enough with a minor crime that snowballs irrevocably out of control, and you become more and more immersed in the story with each new plot twist. Director Nash Edgerton doesn't have the visual panache of his American counterparts, but he knows how to tell a story, slowly and naturally with a gradual escalation of tension.
The acting is serviceable, but this film isn't about the acting. There are no stand-out performances, and none were needed. It's the script that pulls you in, and the sheer joy of watching these people dig themselves in deeper and deeper. The surprises never let up, as Edgerton is not content to let his film grow stagnant, and it builds to an utterly earth-shattering conclusion that I never saw coming. 
It was co-written by the director's brother Joel, who is quickly becoming a very popular actor stateside, and judging from this he'll have a fine backup career behind the camera if the acting thing doesn't work out for him. Even when things start to spiral hopelessly into chaos, the picture never loses its sense of realism, and as crazy as things get, it never feels farfetched or out of the realm of possibility. That is the key that keeps the film grounded and accessible.
And unlike a lot of its American equivalents, it doesn't resort to a lot of unnecessarily bloody violence. ""The Square"" relies strictly in the confidence of its story to be successful, and while it doesn't quite join the ranks of ""Blood Simple"" or the like, it's a very entertaining noir all the same.",The Square
3,"Really good movie, but one that thinks that it's better than it actually is.  Not that I have a problem with that, since the movie is at least good.  If it was bad, it would be completely different.  It also takes forever to get to the point and the movie isn't really that long, it tries to create a lot of threads while not sticking to one in particular.  That was a problem, in my opinion.  But don't let that dissuade you from watching as it's a very smartly written neo noir movie with good suspense.",The Square
1,"The plot is so overdone and the acting so flat that I couldn't sit through this. I suffered through half an hour and decided I had tortured myself enough.

4,"This is one of the best Australia film's I've ever seen. I am very surprised that some director here in the US has stole the idea, like is done with so many Japanese Films. The title the Square is misleading. it should be called the Tangled Web, or the Rousted Triangle, cause that what you have. Claire van der Boom plays an excellent part as a young beautiful everyday women in an affair with a older man, wanting to get away from her abusive husband, who ha come up with a large sum of money hidden in his attic, which she finds, and now has the money to run away with her lover, So starts the web / square of involvement of people that all become linked together one way or another.

Directed by: Nash Edgerton
R, 1 hr. 45 min.
Release Date: April 9, 2010 

Really cool small time action drama (crime thriller) set at a developing yard and the respective errm community whereas shadiy deals and adultery are almost everybodies business but who`s got the go to do anything about any of it. 

A lot going on, a fairly busy movie and dosn`t even give you more than a chuckle to waste as the suspense is limited but consistant enough carried through.

What to do when an adulterous get away go`s from bad to worse to woefully wrong and then some, carry it through as you see theres no perfect ending to a tale like this you just gotta wait and see.",The Square

3,"This would have been more enjoyable had I never seen ""spider"", Edgerton's short film. I knew what to expect from the ending, but it still remains a very competent modern noir.",The Square
4,"Very entertaining, very dark humoured, very Coen-esk Aussie flick.",The Square
3,"The action in The Square takes place in a small Australian town, a town so small that everyone knows everyone at least casually, and when a party is arranged most of the residents are invited.

Two of these residents are middle aged construction foreman Ray (David Roberts) and a hairdresser in her early 20s named Carla (Claire van der Boom - an awesome stripper name if there ever was one!). Ray and Carla are married... but not to each other.

Things start going wrong early, but on a smaller scale. Ray and Carla intend to leave their respective spouses and skip town, but first they need cash. To come up with the cash they each come up with a plan, Ray cuts a side deal with a shonky contractor, and Carla's plan involves theft and just a pinch of arson.

""It's not like anyone will get hurt"", she reasons. How wrong she is.

The Square is as dark as films come, everyone in the film is varying degrees of shonky otherwise they don't get any lines. No room for the honest here Mate. But this is a decidedly non-Hollywood noir, the protagonists aren't gangsters or hitmen or criminal geniuses, they are tow-truck drivers, hairdressers and local slobs.

As the ever growing bodycount envelops both the innocent and the not so... more and more are intertwined in an ever more complex story that should have begun and ended with Ray and Carla skipping town. Alas once the paranoia, mistrust and guilt leads to cover up, murder and betrayal no-one in The Square is destined for a happy ending.

As a viewer I kept thinking ""Now how are you gonna get out of this?"" and ""Don't do that you dickhead"", but the actions of those involved never stray into cartoon or the illogical - at least to them. It might take a leap of faith to pretend all the events in the film happen over a short time frame, but it isn't beyond the stretch of the imagination to think most of this stuff could happen.

I just hope it never happens near me.

Final Rating - 6 / 10. An effective and intricately drawn drama that will keep you guessing and involved until the very end, even once you realise there cannot possibly be a happy outcome.

Edgerton's noirish thriller serves up a prime slice of Aussie crime thriller that seems to be conventional and fresh at the same time, if a little over plotted in places.   The cast are all on good from, with David Roberts looking suitably down trodden through out.   David Mychod's 'Animal Kingdom' is a far superior example of contemporary Australian crime thrillers, but this is a fine first feature from Edgerton.",The Square

3,The story is very good. It keeps you guessing for a good portion of the movie. The acting is good as well. Definitely worth the rent.,The Square
3,"A decent enough thriller which makes up for what it lacks in depth with some nice plot twists.
It's the kind of script that you imagine finds it's way on to the Coen brothers desk on a weekly basis.  A real estate developer seeks to get away with his mistress after she finds a bag load of cash her husband has stashed.  Complications naturally begin to occur when a spot of friendly, paid for arson goes a bit wrong and debts need to be collected and secrets need to be kept.
The Australian cast are not recognisable but good enough.  A lot of the blokes seem to have the same kind of beard and look a bit like Toady from Neighbours which leads to a bit of confusion from time to time but the central guy is good as the man who's simple plan is rapidly falling apart.
The script pulls many turns and twists along the way, and the film is directed with a tense edge which guarantees that the audience will keep watching.  There's a nice who's doing it style storyline running through out the movie which is the most engaging part of the film and is a great keep you guessing element.
The Square lets itself down with it's characterisation unfortunately.  The film's protagonists are all quite one dimensional and have little depth which means the film sometimes falters and feels a little bit half baked.  By the end of the movie, it's the twists which are leaving the impression, while you're hard pushed to remember who everybody was and how they fitted in.  The men in the film especially are almost interchangeable.
The Square is nice little thriller, a gritty edge lending it that aforementioned Coen feel.  It's no Fargo or No Country For Old Men but it's pretty good.",The Square
4,"Nash Edgerton's thriller, The Square, is a gripping crime-caper-gone-wrong storyline, which despite having come several times before doesn't fail to present itself as original. Great performances, especially from the leads - who sink deeper and deeper as it emerges they are in way over their heads.
Great Aussie filmmaking!",The Square

4,"Film Noir isn't dead....It just has moved down under. This is a really good film by way of Australia. Chock full of twists and angles, and a numerous body count, The Square is proof that some of the best stories are coming out of Indieville. A thriller worthy of a spot in your queues.",The Square
3,"Wonderfully performed and directed, but the slow pace of the film (which is characteristic of Aussie films) holds this noir-based thriller from being great.",The Square
4,"This recent movie from Australia shows that the spirit of film noir never dies - it's as alive in contemporary Australia as it was in 1940s Hollywood. The Square is a lot like a Coen brothers film, particularly Blood Simple; it's not quite as good as Blood Simple, but even to be mentioned in the same sentence is quite an honor. Interestingly, like Blood Simple, this movie was also the first film from a pair of brothers.

The story, which is reminiscent of Blood Simple and Double Indemnity, revolves around two people having an affair with each other who think they can get away with stealing the woman's husband's money and running off together. Ha. You can imagine that things don't go as planned. David Roberts gives a low-key, convincing performance as Ray; he's apparently the only man in town without unspeakably bad facial hair, so no wonder the woman has an affair with him. Clair van der Boom is good as the woman in the affair, who doesn't realize what a mess things are really becoming.

The movie refuses to sensationalize. There's only one or two sex scenes between the two lead characters, and they are not eroticized at all. The violence is quick, realistic, and final. While this approach serves the film well for the most part and makes it feel quite realistic, it does lead to a somewhat underwhelming climax. Blood Simple kept things buttoned down for the most part, then splurged for a dramatic and nerve-wracking ending; The Square is reserved almost to a fault at points. Still, though, the movie delivers some quite surprising twists, and I appreciated the cynicism and black irony of the conclusion. If, like me, you enjoy watching people trying to scheme their way into something and then being ruthlessly punished by fate for their hubris, then you'll like The Square.",The Square
2,"Good, not great. A really exciting set up gives way to a kind of muddled, plodding second act.

The bigger problem, though, is that you can't root for any of these characters. I honestly didn't care whether or not the two leads lived happily ever after or not. My favorite character was the dog, who suddenly dies in the middle of the movie.",The Square

2,"thoughts:

the acting isn't great

the twists eventually come of the variety ""what's the worst that could go wrong"". I know. oh that guy fell on a sharp metal spike jutting out of the dirt. and let's put a baby in the crashed car. feels like it's trying too hard.  oh. guess who doesn't hit the floor when shots are erratically fired and gets hit in the head with a bullet. it's all very over the top. and supremely despondent. 

and there are no sympathetic characters. in the end it's hard to care what happens to any of the characters. 

and in the end the lead character is back to where he started before the mess began, and I wish I was too, 2 hours before I wasted my time. 

the final twist with his foreman boss is actually welcome because it's so outside of the storyline so far. but rather than leave the movie with a gnawing sense that this bad person got away with all the stuff on a misunderstanding at work it ends with a near Hamlet style shootout.",The Square

The plot is explained poorly enough that I wasn't sure why the development happened or how it was set up, which I think is somewhat important to a movie.

5,"The first words in this Australian noir thriller are spoken to Ray, the architect at the center of the film by Carla, his mistress. ""You're going to get me in trouble,"" she kids him.

And, how.

But, the hapless Ray doesn't intend to get Carla or anyone else in trouble. He's so p**-whipped, though, he agrees to a scheme he knows is wrong because Carla asks him to. The casualties of his greed begin stacking up in Biblical and almost comical proportions.

Turns out, though, that this plan he hatches with Carla isn't the only crooked plan Ray is involved in. His greed knows no bounds, and he gathers so many enemies that, when he begins to get blackmailed, he has no idea which one of his haters could be coming after him.

Actually, he does hazard some guesses. But, they all turn out to be tragically wrong. Things go from bad to worse to ""Oh. My. God."" in a hurry.

The passion Ray and Carla feel for each other at the beginning of the film must be put on hold (or was it really there to begin with?), as both deal with the tragic consequences of their greed, ineptitude and plain bad luck.

4,"""The Square"" is one of those clever noir films that trumpets the debut of a hot young director(s). This one was made by a couple of Aussie brothers named Edgerton, Joel and Ethan, er..um..sorry..Joel and Nash, and it is similiar to other fatalistic film debuts like the Coen's ""Blood Simple"" or the Wachowski's ""Bound"". It's not quite as impressive as THOSE debuts, but I'm a big fan of this genre, and this movie didn't disappoint. Frankly, I don't think they make ENOUGH movies like this. They churn out mindless rom-coms like once a week, usually starring that awful Heigl woman, but we're lucky to get two decent noirs a year. 

Anyway, I won't spoil the plot, it's essentially Murphy's Law as applied to a desperate crime, but I will say that if this is rented on DVD there is a short film included in the extras called ""Spider"" that is NOT TO BE MISSED. I can't stress this enough. It's only about ten minutes - I'm sure you can spare it - and it's a real corker. DO NOT MISS IT!

He's got it all, a good career, a wife, a nice house, but there's something else he wants more than anything - his neighbor's wife, Carla, whom he is engaged in an affair with. Ray and Carla hatch a plan to make off with some money amid a staged break in, but it goes terribly awry. Things are set in motion and they keep escalating as the two lovers attempt to conceal their adultery and their crimes from not only the authorities, but from Carla's dangerously short tempered husband Greg.

Cool twists as well as an ending that made me jump up and yell 'Oh hell!' I recommend turning on subtitles though, as the Aussie accents and slang can cause things to be missed.",The Square

This film has a ton of twists and turns, many of which you don't see coming at all.  The acting is very solid and the writing and plot really work.  This film is made by two brothers, one who acts in it too, and it definitely reminds me of the earlier Coen Brothers films.

Edgerton has a good cast to work with and never seems to let the movie linger even though the themes and scenarios presented have that seen it all before feeling.

4,"Nash Edgerton is Australian for Christopher Nolan. My second Aussie film in as many days and it's another big winna!

Ebert loves this movie and said it is correctly compared to ""A Simple Plan."" I was thinking of that same movie with Billy Bob Thornton but couldn't think of the title. 

Ebert hammers away on the fact that all that can go wrong in this movie does go wrong. If there is any drawback, maybe they took it just a bit too far. It is well-paced, well-written, well-acted, etc, but it does lose a little bit of plausibility given all the things that happen. Still, I don't watch too many of those flicks for this very reason and this one was still compelling. Great ending and the first 45 minutes, before it all goes to shit, is a pretty great setup.

Claire van der Boom is Australian for Jenna Fischer. Completely hot and a good actress to boot. Roberts is very good in a subtle way. All the shifty characters are well-done and a great addition as well.

As Ebert said, a lot of movies like this go too far and too fast. The big plus on this one is that it doesn't go too fast. I think it might have gone a little too far or maybe it gets 9/10, but nothing wrong with 8/10 on Edgerton's first work.",The Square
3,"The twists nearly all involved under-developed characters that looked so much alike it was hard to tell them apart; much less care about them. Those Aussie's are nearly as hard to understand as the English, but I don't hold it against the film. What I do hold against it was the lack of a real payoff. And no explanation for the demise of the DOG!",The Square

3,"Pretty good modern noir film about some stolen money and the shit it brings down in an australian neighborhood.

I look forward to seeing what they'll do next.",The Square
4,"It succeeds as a crime film, as a thriller, as a drama film. The pacing is just perfect and it builds tension from the first 15 minutes and goes higher and higher reaching its peak at the climax.

There are so many good things to say about The Square, except for its ending which may be a turn-off for the average moviegoer.",The Square

None of the characters are particularly likeable - especially not Ray, the sour-faced main character.

4,"The genre has been done so many times before, and so well (see Blood Simple, Fargo, and a Simple Plan, for a few examples) but The Square proves that exceptional filmmakers can still make the ""same old story"" fresh and gut clenching.  We know where the characters are headed when we first meet them, and the inescapable feeling of tragedy hangs over the entire film, even when things are ""happy"" at the beginning. This feeling, though, doesn't ruin or spoil the rest of the film, which, despite the ridiculous coincidences and happenstance occurrences, moves forward with unrelenting consequences facing every character involved in the plot. Masterful writing and directing and excellent performances put this film up there just below, but not far, the best of the genre.",The Square
3,"Nash Edgerton's first foray into feature-length film bears all the hallmarks of the classic noir: a weak man forced into nefarious deeds by desire and an escalating series of mishaps that lead to his downfall. By utilising his own skills as a master of surprise, Edgerton delivers the shocks while restraining the dramatics, leading his audience a not-so-merry dance along the way. Effectively understated performances from a mostly unknown cast give gravity to the plot (much like the Coens' cast for Blood Simple) which twists and turns like a good noir should. A cracker from Australia's finest young director making his leap from short films with this satisfying and smart little movie.",The Square

It started off dreadfully slow and didn't deliver a near good enough culmination of events in the end to warrant the viewer having sat through so many dull moments.  In fact the last 15% of the movie seemed so thrown together; I felt almost ripped off at the dry way they brought it all together. 

I rate this movie 62/100

4,The plot may sound familier... some cash is involved and one bad thing leads to another.  This film had me engaged and it reminded me of a Cohen Brothers story (very Blood Simple).,The Square
3,"The square is one hell of a movie!

The Good:

From the opening scene to the final showdown you are locked in your seat! The film has everything that makes for a classic thriller. From noteworthy performances by it's cast to heart stopping tension, I think this is a film Hitchcock could be proud of. While there is violence in the film, I would say that most of the tension comes from the build up of the story. You know it's all going to blow up in their faces, you just don't know when! The wait is worth while and as entertaining as any thriller I have seen in a while! This definitely makes my list for top 3 thrillers of the year thus far! 

The Bad:

While the characters and performances are incredibly realistic, the story is essentially hard to believe. This factor is the only thing that keeps me from giving it a better overall rating. You definitely need to suspend disbelief at times to become completely immersed in the story. I can say however, that the movies flaws are overshadowed by it's genius. 

Overall:

One of the better thrillers of the year, complete with powerhouse performances,  a tension building story line, and masterful execution. SEE. IT!!!",The Square

4,"It sounds like a simple plan for these lovers.  Burn the woman's house down, steal the husband's hidden cash, and run away to paradise.  Hah, we know adultery and crime don't pay since we've watched ""The Postman Always Ring Twice,"" ""Body Heat,"" and ""Double Idemnity.""  What unfolds will keep you on the edge of your seat because the situation will get intense, unpredictable, and complicated.

It's best to leave the details to the viewer so as not to spoil this thriller.  I can't remember a recent movie that is so intense.  I admit it's needlessly complicated and there's too many characters and subplots to keep track.  However, if you stick with it, you'll be rewarded for a very engaging drama.  At the back of my mind, I wondered if I really want to visit Australia next year since there's no redeemable character in sight.  Kudos to director Nash Edgerton for a brilliant job in bringing the implausibilities of the plot to light in a believable fashion.

At the end, the audience is left with the conclusion that love may not conquer crime but some people will do anything to prove their love.  Money is just the root of crime, nothing else.",The Square

Complete lack of understanding of ""noir genre"". Camera work I found to be uninspired at best. Veritable dirth of character development (if there are no characters who can draw IN the audience, seduce, tease, cajole, charm, etc. ....WHO CARES WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! A screaming deficit  of tension other than waiting for the next onslaught of violence.
The short shown at the beginning (Spider?)was akin to cliff notes for the film with less time consumed.

Even after only five minutes in, the film begins to unfold in a surreal, mesmerizing fashion, moving swiftly from one frustratingly intriguing circumstance to the next , absorbing you in its gripping web of chaos and disaster.  On par with A Simple Plan and Blood Simple, this powerhouse film about a man and a woman who plan to run off with her husband's gangster money see their lives go from bad to appallingly worse.  The film is nothing short of a masterpiece and it's one of the best movies I've seen in years.",The Square
3,"I saw a well done, cleverly shocking short called Spider by a director named Nash Edgerton at a previous film fest, but I'm not the kind of film-goer with an encyclopedic memory for names of actors or directors, so I didn't decide to see this film, The Square, because I was looking forward to seeing this director's first feature length film. Maybe one day I'll be that plugged in, but I wouldn't have known if it wasn't for the fact they showed Spider before this film, which was great to create context for the director's style.

The Square is not as unexpected as Spider, but it is a well devised Film Noir. (screenplay written by brother, Joel Egerton) Set in Australia in a mostly blue collar type town, where instead of train tracks, a small body of water seems to be a dividing line between the really blue collars and the management blue collars. This body of water doesn't prevent Construction foreman, Ray (David Roberts) from starting an affair with beautician, Carla (Claire van der Boom).

We're not privy to how long the affair has been going on or how they met, we meet them at the inevitable cross roads of most affairs - ""when are you going to leave your wife and run away with me?"" of which the man in the affair gives the standard answer of ""soon"". Here's where the standard makes a departure, Carla discovers the man she lives with has been up to some wrong doing and has stashed a duffel bag full of cash in the attic crawl space. Carla decides this is the perfect opportunity for escape with Ray, she proposes they steal the money and hire an arsonist to make it look like the house happened to catch on fire. But Ray's a normal guy, nothing gangster about him, he may be willing to cheat on his wife with a younger woman, but he's not looking for real trouble, so he turns Carla down, at first. If only he stuck with his first mind,
but because Carla breaks it off with him for refusing the plan, he agrees; which unfortunately sets off a chain of tragic events which Ray can't stop.

The heart wants what the heart wants, but my personal thought on the matter is, if you are going to commit a crime for somebody, that person should be smart, incredibly beautiful, fascinating, unique and really hot. Carla is ordinary attractive, kinda a cross between Paula Marshall & Lee Lee Sobieski(example pics), which Egerton says was intentional- read below for hightlights from the Q&A:

Edgerton was asked about starting out as a stuntman.

NE: Yeah I started doing stunts when I was 18 to work in the film industry. Me and my friends would work on action sequences on the weekends to put in our show reels to get stunt jobs. The appreciation for the craft of making films came out of that.

What movies did you work on as a stuntman?

NE: The Matrix, Mission Impossible, Star Wars, I did a lot of different things, about 120 different films and TV shows.

The genre is Film Noir , the hero is very ambiguous in terms of his morality, you want to like him you want him to be a good guy, but he keeps making all these bad decisions. And Carla is not your normal femme fatal, she's not really a scheming seductress.

NE: I didn't want them to be black and white characters. I wanted them to be more like real people. When real people have an affair, they don't look for an evil seductress, they have an affair with someone they found a connection with. She's in a relationship where they don't really communicate, he's in a marriage where they've fallen out of love. And because they've found each other doesn't mean their affair has to be this steamy, sexy thing. They've made a connection and may be in this for a while... I just wanted them to be like real people so when they did all these things it would be more feasible and probably more tense because they aren't heightened characters.

Your brother Joel plays the arsonist in the film and he co-wrote the screenplay, what is your working relationship with him?

NE: He's my little brother so he just does what he's told :) No, he's my best friend, we get along really well. The story was his idea, it came out of his sick mind and I like to encourage that mind of his; we have skills that compliment each other.

Do you have distribution for this film?

NE: Yes. Apparition. The film opened in New York, it opens in Philadelphia on April 23rd, next San Diego, Berkley and Boston, it's slowly kinda rolling out. I got an amazingly strong review in the New York Times today. Consistently, it's received good critical feedback everywhere it's played in Australia and France where it's been prior to the US today. The audiences are always very vocal like you all were tonight. So I don't know if that means there's something wrong with me or something wrong with you :)

Do you feel any affinity with the Cohen Brothers?

NE: I definitely like their films. And yeah, me and my brother are brothers. I'm mean it's flattering to be compared, but I feel like we've made one film and they've made many, so let's see what happens in the next 10 years.

0,"TERRIBLE, waste of time and money!!!",The Square
3,"A film that takes you down the road paved by all the wrong choices. It's sylish and gets the blood pumping with repressed anxiety, however, you never really crave the success of anyone, instead you just observe as the story cleverly drags you to hell with the unlikable characters. This film develops well gaining more complexety with each action but it never really grips you beyond your will and has no revelation that you didn't see coming from the start.",The Square
4,"Some movies beg for comparison to others, and the film that ""The Square"" most resembles is ""Body Heat."" Both dramas fall into the category of film noir, both feature illicit lovers doing very bad things, and both want nothing more than to ratchet up audience tension.

""The Square"" mostly succeeds, but it falls short of Lawrence Kasdan's 1981 classic for a number of reasons. ""The Square"" doesn't have two compelling characters, it has just one (the male lead). And director Nash Edgerton's film lacks something else found in ""Body Heat"" -- a delicious twist at the end. It tries to compensate for that shortcoming by jacking up the body count.

David Roberts plays everyman Ray Yale, a married construction foreman carrying on with Carla (Claire van der Boom), who is married to a small-time crook. When Carla discovers her husband's stash of stolen cash, she persuades Ray that the money is their ticket to paradise.

Ray reluctantly goes along with Carla's plan, and of course their scheme rapidly goes from bad to worse. Edgerton does a nice job building suspense, but ""The Square"" is handicapped by a script that has plenty of bodies, just not enough soul.",The Square
4,"This is a film that starts light - two dogs, two people having an affair.  Maybe that's not light in some philosophies, but the way it expands into darker territory with a threshold scheme of robbery and arson, this Australian piece of film noir has the main characters descend into a out-of-control spiral of more violent crimes.  It's not a happy film, but it does engage the viewer as you sit back and wait to see what happens next. Good performances all around bolster the film, but it's the multi-layered plot that takes command.  My lady and I were also fortunate to see the short film by the producers called ""Spider"" which begins small, then just expands outward (like an arachnoid and its legs?) over the course of several minutes.  Hopefully, when the film is released on DVD, ""Spider"" will be one of the extras.  Sincerely, Hitchboy",The Square
4,"This movie will keep you engrossed and guessing from the very first reel.  Similar in style and tone to a Cohen Bros. film (one of the heavy ones, like ""Blood Simple"") I can't stress enough what pleasures await the true cinema lover who encounters ""The Square,"" from the unique setting, the fine acting, the suspense of the story line, to the skill of the young filmmakers involved with the production.  To try to tell you what it's about would be pointless; it quite fun to puzzle it out as you go along.

4,"The first Terminator is a simple, brutal and an action-packed science fiction classic. It is absolutely a horror film at times and the impeccable sense of dread carried by Arnie's performance as the Terminator really makes you feel that.

5,"Terminator 1 was far more better than the sequel. Sarah Connor's predestined meeting with the father of her child had real human touch of both acting and direction. And yes, the action was fantastic. Arnie was not a completely invincible cyborg. It was hard, very hard to get him but they finally did. The struggle with Arnie looked more natural.

The whole terminator timeline dosent really make sense to me but I still think it's amazing and I love kyle reese because you can see how much he cares for sarah connor.

4,"The Terminator - Movie Review (82.2)

Behind the Scenes: 77.3/100
	‚Ä¢	Acting: (7.5) It's hard to rate this category because, similar to the Star Wars Prequels, it wasn't that the actors were doing a bad job, but that the dialogue and scene direction was poorly written. Sarah Connor was just very helpless and sort of unlikable, Kyle Reese was heroic in a cringey way, and Schwarzenegger‚Ä¶.well his acting skills were already wooden and RoBOtiC (get it?) from the beginning, so he didn't do too bad. The only thing worthy of criticism, was the line delivery, which was bad.
	‚Ä¢	Directing: (9.1) the scene pacing was actually pretty good. I felt that all action scenes were directed and choreographed well, along with the special effects. I also felt that the camera angles and cuts were perfect and revolutionary in shaping the future of blockbuster action scenes.
	‚Ä¢	Music (likability/use): (9.7) the music in this movie was utilized very well, and, while some of the techno stuff was cringey, it was very likable and 100% for the thriller/sci-fi/heroism vibe that was portrayed throughout the movie. 
	‚Ä¢	Dialogue: (4.6) like the Star Wars Prequels (again) the dialogue in this movie was cool and iconic. So, when in awesome action scenes full of tense moments, the phrase ""Come with me if you want to live!"" is iconic and fitting, BUT when the main characters are trying to run and hide from the police but stop to take a monologue break about EXTREMELY unnecessary things, I can't help but sigh in disappointment. 

Characters: 82/100
	‚Ä¢	Protagonist: (7.8) I'll mention this in the plot, but this movie was never meant to be emotionally complex or compelling, so the characters in this movie all follow the classic format of Damsel in Destress, Knight in Shining armor, and Evil Scary monster. So Sarah definitely follows that stereotype very well, but other than that, there's nothing to her. We did get a good amount of quality time with her though, so that helps the score.
	‚Ä¢	Antagonist: (9.3) considering the fact that the entire movie was not only named, but revolves around him, he was fantastic. The only thing I'd change is that it would've been nice to see some variety in his action scenes, it was all mainly the same stunts and moves. That, and I would've made him more internally completing to the main characters, which he wasn't. 
	‚Ä¢	Arcs: (7.0) the benefit to this is the fact that there were only two main characters, so only two arcs were needed. The odd detriment is that neither of them really got one. Kyle Reese has a partial exception because his character wasn't the type that needed a change or an internal struggle, but Sarah Connor has no compromises. If I hadn't seen Terminator 2, then I would say she learned nothing from Reese. Her character definitely had the beginning of an arc, but there was never an opportunity to show off what she learned, so there's no point.
	‚Ä¢	Relevance: (8.7) similar to the situation with the character arcs, there weren't many characters, so it was easy to make them all fill the relevance role. 
 
Plot: 84.3/100
	‚Ä¢	Pacing: (9.3) the scene and plot point pacing was actually really good, it gave enough time to get to know the characters. The only downside was the dump of unnecessary exposition at the beginning, which really slowed the plot down.
	‚Ä¢	Conflict use: (9.9) not only did they do everything right, but it was utilized perfectly. The story was always driven by the antagonist and it portrayed his threat to the protagonist PERFECTLY. The Terminators were the driving force of every single plot in the movie, present and future. The only downside ever shown, was how predictable his actions were, but even still, this allowed for tension to rise.
	‚Ä¢	Structure: (7.6) nothing was structured poorly, or harmful to the plot, it's just that we didn't spend much time in other plot points other than running and hiding. It would've been nice to utilize the cops by not killing all of them and so you could continue to use some of the named detectives. Also, the final battle came very unexpectedly and fast. 
	‚Ä¢	Resolution: (6.9) extremely predictable. Not only was it original creative-wise, but the action wasn't much different from everything else in the movie. The only positive plot point that took place was Reese's death, BUT it was executed poorly and almost completely glossed over in the end. If they were going to have a show of strength for Sarah in honor of her character arc (which they sort of did) then they should've made it longer, more impactful, and more obvious emotionally.

Bonus Points:
	‚Ä¢	The idea and concept for the story is basic but so good, it would honestly be hard to ruin a movie based off a cool time travel concept like this since it's already very interesting. I'm jealous. (1 point)

Final Synopsis:
This movie was meant for nothing more than to show off James Cameron's action packed directing and the coolness of the Terminator character. In other words, the didn't give my care or effort into the story or it's characters. They pretty much just followed the oldest story genre of all time, monster terrorizing people, the only difference feature is the cool future twist they put on it.

And while a cliche story might sound bad, it's important to remember that many other really good movies have done the same. For example, Star Wars: A New Hope. In this story, a young boy goes on and adventure to save a princess with an old wizard mentor who trains him to become a sword wielding (Jedi) knight, sound familiar. In other words, when it comes to a story, it's less about what story you tell, and more about how you tell it and make it entertaining. You can always make something new and unique, but even a used napkin that has been folded into water buffalo can captivate an audience. 

The plot is extremely original and basic, but it's executed and conveyed VERY well.",The Terminator
3,Great movie. 2 is better though. 7.7/10,The Terminator

4,"Love this movie, absolute classic",The Terminator
3,The movie is a great set up for other movies but it is a bit too chessy at times.,The Terminator
4,The Terminator is a great example of a classical thriller movie where the main character is hunted down. One of the best parts about this movie is the main character herself where she changed from a person who keeps running away into a brave fighter.,The Terminator
5,A sci-fi / horror masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Schwarzenegger's finest hour.,The Terminator
3,Arnold is perfectly cast in this simple stripped down scifi blast of film. Incredible practical effects. A chase road story and a great time at the movies. The best is yet to come though.,The Terminator
5,"Sci fi horror at its best 
Arnold was born to play this role the series could not have had a better start 
The ending still to this day is terrifying and the use of a simple name leading to so much death gives this film a pace that rips along 
The slower the terminator walks the more we feel pulled in to its narrative 
It's a film that makes its viewer wait 
You know evil is coming but you never quite know when it will strike 
With a cast that truly give there all in every scene a new horror that is part frenkinstine monster part phantom of the opera stalks us right up to its brutal climax leaving us all hoping this killing machine will indeed be back",The Terminator

5,A shocking look at what the future could look like. Arnold Schwarzenegger does the perfect job portraying your worst nightmare.,The Terminator
5,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, here it is. The one you all been waiting for, The Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and directed by James Cameron. And get this: my old friend Jacob Dimmock, he is a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think everybody's a huge fan of him. This is the first film I've ever looked that has an 100% rating from critics from Rotten Tomatoes and one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films. You can't really go wrong. It's just unbelievable. OK, I'm going to tell you the details. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays an evil cyborg aka The Terminator sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 (the film is been released in the year 1984) to kill Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton before she gets pregnant to the boy who will one day become a savior against machines in a post-apocalyptic future. So he walks naked and comes across the three punks. One was played by the memorable Bill Paxton and two of them I don't know. One of them said ''Nice night for a walk.'' and ''Nothing clean, right?'' and The Terminator starts copying what he is saying and he says ''Your clothes. Give them me, now.'' and the punk leader says ''Fxxk you, axxhole!'' so the Terminator starts beating the punks and kills one of them by punching through his chest, pulls his fist out full of blood and holding his heart and one of them takes his clothes off and makes him wear them. I didn't know he punches through his heart at first because all I can see is a pool of blood but I think my brother had a reaction from that scene what The Terminator had just did. Then we see Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese as an soldier from the future (one possible future) sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor and the first chase scene is gripping it's dark. There's a scene where Sarah goes to the nightclub where the 80s party songs are on is a scene where she's been tracked down by The Terminator and Kyle Reese but Reese protects her from The Terminator before he kills her. I love the pacing and directing for this scene, it's unbelievably brilliant. Now the second chase scene where Kyle drives away from the cyborg Terminator and explains to Sarah that The Terminator can't be bargained with and can't be reasoned with and doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear and absolutely will not stop ever, until she is dead. Now the scene The Terminator is cleaning himself by cutting through his wrist and wipes his face and eyes but pulls his eye out and use a cloth to clean through his eye patch and as you can see Arnold looks so different when he get the cloth out of his eye and you can clearly see that his eye is an robotic cyborg skeleton. OK, there is a shootout scene after Arnold famously says his memorable favourite quote of all time that many people has impressed and blown away by is ''I'll be back.'' I bet he says that at every single movie he does. And there's a scene where the person says ''Hey, you got a dead cat in here or what?'' and The Terminator chooses the possible response choosing Yes/No or What?, Go away, Please come back later, Fxxk you, axxhole and Fxxk you. He chose by saying ''Fxxk you, axxhole.'' I even chuckled at that scene. And that it, that's the end of it. I didn't tell about The Terminator killing the wrong Sarah Connor or the ending cause I think you and the audience in the world have already know that movie by heart. Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't talk much in this film because The Terminator is so quiet and keeps in character while filming. That's why his character is so great in this film. Linda Hamilton is great in this so is Michael Biehn and all the actors and actresses who did their fantastic portrayal in this movie. Well, guys, I guess you've all know this movie by heart and James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd did their fantastic job making this film. Even the special effects at the end looks sort of Stop-Motion-ish. I don't know, it looks like it's from the older films like Sinbad and King Kong and all the other dinosaur films. Jeez. Anyways, The Terminator is one of my favourite films of all time along with the others like Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Highlander, Goldeneye, Bird On A Wire and many more. So I guess this is it then. 10/10. Favorite of all time. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",The Terminator

5,"""The Terminator"" is a 1984 sci-fi/action film directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. The movie is widely regarded as a classic and has become a cult favorite among fans of the sci-fi genre.

The plot follows a cyborg assassin (Schwarzenegger) who is sent back in time from the future to kill Sarah Connor (Hamilton), a waitress who will eventually give birth to the leader of the human resistance against the machines. A human soldier, Kyle Reese (Biehn), is also sent back in time to protect Sarah and ensure that the future does not change.

One of the biggest strengths of ""The Terminator"" is its excellent pacing. The film moves at a breakneck speed, with tension and suspense building throughout. The action scenes are well-choreographed and visually striking, particularly for a film made on a relatively modest budget.

The performances are also strong across the board. Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the emotionless killing machine, while Biehn brings a sense of vulnerability and humanity to his role as the time-traveling soldier. Hamilton also shines as the initially helpless waitress who must quickly adapt to a dangerous and uncertain new reality.

The film's direction and cinematography are also noteworthy. Cameron's use of low-angle shots and close-ups during the action scenes gives the film a gritty and visceral feel, while the use of blue tones and neon lighting throughout helps to create a distinctive and memorable aesthetic.

""With themes of fate and determinism, the dehumanization of technology, and sacrifice and selflessness, these elements are woven into the story and characters, adding a layer of complexity and significance to the film. The movie suggests that, despite our best efforts to alter the future, certain events are predestined to happen.

However, there are some weaknesses to the film as well. The special effects, while impressive for their time, do show their age in certain scenes. Additionally, some of the dialogue can come across as cheesy or over-the-top.

Overall, ""The Terminator"" is a highly entertaining and well-crafted film that has stood the test of time. Its strong performances, excellent pacing, and distinctive visual style make it a classic of the sci-fi and action genres. While it may not be perfect, it is certainly worth a watch for anyone who enjoys thrilling and thought-provoking cinema.",The Terminator
3,"Overall I thought Terminator was a decent movie, not anything spectacular, but the solid plot and a great villain make this movie fairly entertaining. The acting overall is pretty lackluster and keeps Terminator from being more than a generic action movie in my opinion.",The Terminator
5,"The Terminator, directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, is a low budget sci-fi thriller that has become a cinematic masterpiece since its release in 1984. The film tells the story of a cyborg assassin sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, a woman who will one day give birth to a son who will lead a rebellion against the machines.

Despite its low budget and relatively unknown cast, The Terminator is a cinematic triumph that has influenced countless films in the sci-fi and action genres. The film's script is tight and well-structured, with a clear narrative arc that builds tension and suspense from beginning to end. The characters are complex and believable, with Schwarzenegger delivering a standout performance as the emotionless killing machine.

What sets The Terminator apart from other low budget films of its time is its groundbreaking use of practical effects and innovative camera techniques. The film's action sequences are visceral and intense, with Cameron using tight close-ups and handheld camera work to put the viewer right in the middle of the action.

But perhaps the most impressive aspect of The Terminator is its underlying themes of fate and free will. The film explores the idea of a predetermined future and the power of individuals to make choices that can change their destiny. It's a thought-provoking theme that elevates the film above a typical action movie.

In the end, The Terminator is a masterpiece of cinema that proves that a low budget film can still be a groundbreaking work of art. It's a thrilling, suspenseful ride that delivers on all fronts, from the script and performances to the innovative camera work and practical effects. Even almost 40 years after its release, The Terminator remains a timeless classic that has left a lasting impact on cinema.",The Terminator

Un guion s√≥lido con un buen argumento. De lo m√°s memorable se encuentra la banda sonora de Brad Fiedel cuyo tema principal se volvi√≥ ic√≥nica y los efectos especiales de Stan Winston que ya son una reliquia admirable.

P.S. Great concept for 1984, also there was a $4.50 cover charge to enter a nightclub back in 1984. It's free these days or ticketed or $20 in some places in DTLA. The story has scenes from 2029 which is six years away, where the protagonist mentions Nuclear war and AI. Seems like a good prediction to me considering Russia/ China and ChatGPT",The Terminator

4,"This looks and sounds so eighties! It is the epitome of the decade. The hair, the production design, the effects, everything in this film is defined by and defines the eighties. Not that it's a bad thing, it is good to be distinctive. The sound design is excellent, surprisingly good considering the age. The music fits with the tone but I did find it a touch synth which comes across as a bit cheesy. The story is actually really strong and incredibly well told. I love time travel and robots! The future war scenes compliment and contrast the eighties perfectly. The slow menacing stalker makes this feel a little like a slasher horror movie, again a very good thing. My only real gripe is that it is occasionally a little slow. Overall it really is an awesome film that never ceases to entertain.",The Terminator

4,"With one word this movie is creepy, though it benefits from it. The premise is pretty simple, ""someone chases someone until they dead"", but the sci-fi elements, and twists make it intriguing and unique for its time, as it influenced so much more.",The Terminator

5,Very well done !!  Perfect for Arnold.  On my top ten list of ALL TIME !,The Terminator
5,"Have not always been a big fan of action films, after seeing my fair share poorly made, dull and predictable, sloppily written and badly acted ones that delivers just as little on the action (the worst of Steven Seagal being prime examples. The Terminator however is like Die Hard, a thrilling well-made film that succeeds as an action film and a film in general, and treats its audience and genre with respect. It is also one of director James Cameron's best films along with Terminator 2 and Aliens.

The Terminator looks great still, sure the special effects have not held up as well as the rest of the film but they are not that bad. The film is beautifully and slickly photographed and the sets and lighting are so imaginative and wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked and immersed into its world., and filled with sharp details. Cameron's direction is superb, some of the best of his whole career. The music score is hauntingly eerie and its synthesised sound doesn't date the film at all, instead adding hugely to the atmosphere. The script (including the famous 'I'll be back') is snappy and smart with plenty of wittily written lines, the story is incredibly engrossing and exciting to the maximum with plenty of suspense and fun.

Action fans are guaranteed too to be thrilled by the action here, being both dynamic and thrilling, the climax really does jangle the nerves. Michael Biehn and especially Linda Hamilton shine in their roles, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character to date. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the greats of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Terminator
5,Best of Movies/TV Series Collection,The Terminator
3,"A great kickoff to an expansive franchise that does a lot of world building with limited budget. Youngers viewers will find the effects dated, but very advance for its time. 

Some surprisingly good Terminator scares at the end.",The Terminator

5,"A movie so far ahead of it's time, yet still makes you believe that this is possible. A masterpiece.",The Terminator
5,YEEEEAAAAAHHHHH BABY!!!!!!,The Terminator
4,"An All Time Science Fiction& 80's Movie Classic. The acting is very well done overall but can be a little weak by Sarah at times. Kyle & the Terminator more than make up for that along with a very strong supporting cast. Editing, Pacing and soundtrack are exceptionally done., along with very good cinematography. That being said the only complain I had that persisted through the film was while 80% of the special effects looked incredible. There were at key points throughout the film where the special effects didn't look good at all (The eye scene & the stop motion Blue Screen at the Door are perfect examples) and it came at key points. But that doesn't take away overall from the phenomenal Action sequences like in the Club, the Shotgun Duel and the Police Station. And one can tell these are clearly because of budget constraints rather than laziness. Overall an absolute classic of its era and genre with a minor flaw that keeps it from being an all time great like its sequel.",The Terminator
5,He may be unstoppable but The Terminator cannot be killed off easily but rather be welcoming as a ground breaking film that made Arnold a movie star.,The Terminator
5,"The movie that started it all and launched James Cameron's career as a director. This film was better than it had any right to be considering its limited budget. The story is tight, centering around a woman who would become the mother of the future, being hunted down by an unstoppable machine and needs to be protected at all costs. It also touches on the concepts of artificial intelligence, technology and it going too far. 

The characters all play their part well. Linda Hamilton grows from a ""down on her luck"" waitress to a stronger, independent woman. Michael Biehn sells it as a scruffy soldier who's just survived a war and is determined to fulfill his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger is pitch perfect as what is now his most iconic role. He's imposing not only physically, but audibly as well. You would really think he's a cyborg, a brute force which will not stop and it works well.

The pacing of events is perfect. Not one moment feels unnecessary. It's tight and straight to the point, never dragging and making the most of its material. It manages to balance tones of suspense, tension and action without them feeling as if they're in conflicting. While it's successor is a Sci-Fi action film, this is more of a Sci-Fi horror. I also appreciate the use of special effects, much of which holds up fairly well and for what doesn't, we can forgive it considering the budget and time period. It's refreshing to see the use of and actual endoskeleton and puppetry for the Terminator and the make up used for eyes. It's so much more engaging to know they actually did this and wasn't merely generated on a computer.

While there is an exploration of technology going to far and artificial technology becoming self aware, the relationships and the humanity of our heroes in contrast to the cold and calculating nature of machines, I think another message which can be pulled from this film and the really the whole franchise is one of survival and what we'll do to survive. The humans of the future and in the present of the film are trying to survive against the Terminator, the machines of the future also waged a war against the humans to survive their extinction, even if it was against the very thing which created. We can enjoy the film but also take away a very memorable message.

In summary, ""The Terminator"" is a timeless film which manages to blend sci-fi, horror, action and a bit of tragic romance and delivers a tight, captivating thrill ride from start to finish. It's one of film's best and one of my personal favourites. It's crazy to think James Cameron managed to somehow top himself with the sequel. Even so, don't sleep on this film, it was the genesis of the story and in a sense, of James Cameron's career.",The Terminator
5,"The Terminator is like the greatest student film ever made.

Director James Cameron's romantic science-fiction action-thriller The Terminator (1984) is all raw moody style with Cameron's clear passion of directing and science-fiction. Cameron's direction delivers a touching romance between the heroine and unlikely hero from the future to creative sci-fi concepts and unreal action. The sheer endless volley of bullets and explosions is spectacular. I love the car chases that are fast, exciting, and look dangerous in the erratic driving and reckless gunfire. The Terminator shows Cameron's style is already established early on in his career with a grounded feeling all the time.

James Cameron shows off his dark atmospheric direction for his grim 1984 cityscapes as well as his post-apocalyptic future world ruled by highly advanced, ruthless robots. How can you not enjoy The Terminator? Arnold guns down the entire police force with ease with a shotgun and machine gun! He feels unstoppable, menacing, and cunning. 

Writers Gale Anne Hurd and James Cameron use efficient minimalist dialogue as they opt to tell this scary and crafty futuristic story with visuals instead. They do provide several neat monologues like Sarah Conner wondering about her future or Kyle Reese monologuing about his poor living conditions in his robot ruled post-apocalyptic future. The one liners are cool, iconic, memorable, and hilarious whereas the romance feels resonant and thoughtful. The Terminator is a groundbreaking concept about cunning robot overlords from a corporation sending a relentless killing machine in the form of the cyborg assassins called Terminators. All the sci-fi ideas are thought out and intriguing to think about as you watch Arnold shoot people with no mercy in his villainous and unfeeling quest to destroy Sarah Connor.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent and iconic as The Terminator. His ruthless pursuit of Sarah Conner is vicious and cold as steel with Arnold's steely glares and funny coldhearted remarks as he guns down all in his path. Arnold makes The Terminator feel both robotic at heart, but also coldly heartless as he'll shoot first, then continue onwards without warning. The Terminator mimicking voices and killing with purpose might have influenced Predator a bit. Arnold is perfect as The Terminator.

Michael Biehn is cool as future resistance fighter Kyle Reese. He's a neat hero with romantic chemistry with Linda Hamilton. His dialogue feels genuine and considerate as he's kind to Sarah Conner and earnest with her about his love and reverence for her. Linda Hamilton's action heroine Sarah Connor is endearing. She's beautiful, relatable, concerned, terrified, and brave as she evades and retaliates against The Terminator's relentless pursuit of her with lethal intentions. She's not just a gun shooting hero, but a regular woman finding herself in an impossibly dangerous game of robot cat and human mouse.

Paul Winfield is interesting and commanding as Lieutenant Ed Traxler. Lance Henriksen plays the sarcastic jerk well as Detective Vukovich. You're happy to watch every police officer get brutally gunned down by Arnold as they're not competent or helpful to Sarah Conner at all. Rick Rossovich is funny as Ginger's horny boyfriend Matt. Bess Motta is pretty and flirty as Sarah's best friend Ginger Ventura. Earl Boen is hysterical as the skeptical psychologist Dr. Peter Silberman. Dick Miller is super funny as the unfortunate pawnshop clerk Arnold happens to acquire his guns from early on in The Terminator. Bill Paxton cameos as the blue mohawk wearing Punk Leader. Brad Rearden and Brian Thompson's punks are so fun in the opening arrival of Arnold's nude cyborg assassin The Terminator.

Editor Mark Goldblatt lets the unsettling future scenes play out for eerie establishing scenes, whereas the visceral action sequences are cut fast and slickly. I appreciate Goldblatt's tasteful cuts during Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese's love making scene. The Terminator moves at a breakneck speed for a fast feeling for 108 minutes. Adam Greenberg's cinematography has dark shadows and exposing lighting everywhere. The Terminator has a bleak and dark look for that grim vibe, but still feels lighthearted enough to be a thriller. The close-ups of the puppets and animatronics are brave and look incredible. There's outstanding visual effects for The Terminator's red robot vision to the stop motion puppetry from visual effects artist Bob Williams.

Art direction from George Costello, Shay Austin, and Maria Caso has neon city nights, ruined futuristic cities, and dirty streets for a gritty aesthetic for The Terminator. There's cool computer visuals that look like something from TRON, but the practical miniatures and Maria Caso's set decoration models that look outstanding to this day.

Composer Brad Fiedel's clunky synth score actually adds a heavy atmosphere to The Terminator. His swirling melodies soar over the pounding synth rhythms with menace as The Terminator approaches. Sound designers James Fritch, Greg Dillon, David J. Hudson, Mel Metcalfe, Terry Porter, David Campling, Karola Storr, James J. Klinger, Gabriel Guy, Mike Le Mare, Gilbert D. Marchant, Gary Shepherd, and Horace Manzanares mix bursts of shotgun fire with creaky robotic movements. I love the laser blasts and roaring car engines among all the gunfire.

Costume designers Deborah Everton and Hilary Wright find every 1980's black leather jacket and grey trench coats among all the blue jeans for Arnold's Terminator and Biehn's Reese. I like Linda Hamilton's cute 80's colorful outfits from her waitress uniform to her nightlife party outfit. The Terminator design is brilliant to whoever made the chrome reflective surfaces and glowing red eyes. Make-up artists Jeff Dawn and Kyle Sweet nail the massive 80's hair and colorful hairstyles. Hamilton's make-up is lovely and suits her.

In conclusion, The Terminator may very well be James Cameron's finest film. It's certainly ambitious and entertaining.",The Terminator
5,"WOW! The best word that describes this movie is ""wow""! Not only to say that this is the best Action movie of all time, this is probably one of the greatest movies ever made .

To be honest, watching this ""The Terminator"" after watching that one will be a bit dull. But if you think about it, the robot that is more likely to be realized is the T-800. That is to say, as the first work of the ""Terminator Series"", it is really not easy to present the concerns caused by technology for the future and make them reasonable as much as possible. It's a pity that the movie was released a bit long ago, some of the pictures are very fake, and the action scenes are not coherent.",The Terminator

From start to finish, the unique story keeps you hooked to the story, and the iconic characters absolutely shine. The action is done very well, and for its time, the CGI is groundbreaking. It's just a timeless classic that is extremely rewatchable no matter how many times you've seen it. One of the best films of all time due to how influential it was and still is.

Also features a star making performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The dialogues and one liners are fantastic. My favorite being ""I'll be back"". The tension is developed so the edge of your seat experience is present. Most of the action scenes work. The only negative is that because this film is 36 years old and it was a low budget film at that time. The special effects especially with the cyborg in the climax has aged poorly.

4,"Why did it take me so long to see this? Nearly everything about this movie is outstanding. The performances are all incredible with Arnold Schwarznegger's incredible screen presence as the Terminator, one of the best villains ever in cinema. He rarely speaks but due to the excellent writing and Arnold's performance, you're truly terrified of the guy. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn also have excellent chemistry and their relationship is really well developed. The effects have aged really well for the most part, the production design and atmosphere for the future is incredibly efficient in making it feel apocalyptic and the story is perfectly paced with a really interesting plotline and as a sucker for apocalyptic movies, it was perfect for me. The action is fast and exciting but also has an element of suspense to me. It's nit about a bunch of explosions and effects but more about suspense as Terminator is determined to kill Sarah. What a great time! I wish we saw more of the future honestly and what happened to the police and manhunt that are meant to be tracking Terminator? They're just forgotten in the seond half for whatever reason and some of the effects have shown their age but I don't care. Watch this if you haven't already!",The Terminator
4,"James Cameron got the idea for The Terminator after dreaming about a chrome skeleton emerging from a fire. The idea of being chased relentlessly by a killer cyborg is something we have all dreamed of in one way or another. It taps into some of our deepest, most natural fears: things that go bump in the night and things we can't escape from. With what was a relatively low budget, Cameron managed to extract a modern masterpiece that is part sci-fi, part action and part horror film. Arnold Schwarzenegger was cut for this role, and its hard to imagine that the film would have succeeded without him. Linda Hamilton also works well as Sarah Connor, a character that traverses the spectrum from a sweet innocent waitress to the tough action heroine who finally puts an end to the killer cyborg. The special effects are what you would expect from a budget film in the pre-CGI era, good enough for you to suspend disbelief and be taken into the world of the Terminator. Cameron does a great job of introducing the characters and narrating the story as it builds to its climatic end. The final scene with Hamilton's character doing the modern equivalent of riding off into the sunset rounds off the film nicely, and leaves you wanting to know what happens next. The Terminator is a classic science fiction action film that is the movie equivalent of a thrilling roller coaster ride.",The Terminator
5,A great movie starring Arnold as the Automation from the future!,The Terminator
4,"It‚Äôs been about ten years since I‚Äôve watched this one. I love how it feels like a horror film more than a science fiction flick. Arnold without eyebrows, guilt, or remorse is the sci-fi Michael Myers! Was this his only bad guy role ever? I think it had the first and best ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back‚Äù moment. The story is excellent, and it looks great. The soundtrack is killer, even during the love scene! I grew up on T2 but find the original to be more timeless.",The Terminator

I would never have dreamed that we'd be headed back to 50 years ago when these brave Janes were helping women to make a choice in the absence of their own rights and freedom. I am sad, angry and disgusted with the extremist minority that has sent us back to this time. Please watch, especially for a man, this film provides a much needed perspective of how badly the infusion of religion and male-controlled politics have robbed women of democracy.",The Janes
5,A compelling documentary that matters now more than ever.,The Janes
3,"The Janes of the title were a group of dedicated women in 1960s Chicago who helped to facilitate (and eventually even perform) abortions. They would meet their clients--many of them poor, more than a few of them mothers already, all of them frightened and with nowhere else to turn--and then chauffeur them to someone's home for the procedure. (The Janes provided something that was desperately needed in those pre-Roe v. Wade days: safe procedures by reliable physicians, and with the promise of adequate follow-up care, as well.) This is very much a ""talking heads"" movie, as one Jane after another is interviewed on camera; complementing their appearances is archival footage of some of the other political movements of the day, including the Vietnam protests and the confrontations outside Chicago's 1968 Democratic National Convention. We meet the fellow, identified only as Mike, who back in the day performed abortions (apparently with a good deal of skill and sympathy) despite having no medical background whatsoever; we even meet the Chicago detective ordered to find these abortion pioneers, and arrest them. (All the cases were dismissed, of course, with the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973, and the Janes disbanded soon after.) ""The Janes"" is horrifying and heartbreaking and, for anyone interested in the history of women's reproductive rights, enlightening, too. It's more topical than ever, and should not be missed. (""Jane"", by the way, was a code word. Anyone in need of help was told to call and ask for ""Jane"". The women's real names were never used.)",The Janes

4,"A hell of of a movie. 

Jonathan Demme (pronounced Dem-Me) directed this iconic and at times rather odd film that makes the most of Talking Heads pop choruses by added funk rhythms, excellent backing vocals and a lot of live energy.

Part of the enduring nature of the film is how spontaneous, rhythmic and natural the performances are but the minimalist lighting and simple, grey outfits are really at odds with stock 80s pop presentation.

Arguably, T.H. were a ""70s and 80s"" type of band, but something that happens over the three live concerts compiled here, with some additional overdubs, is the volume, texture and impact of the material comes across properly; a lot of 80s pop radio mixes were oddly stilted and trebly sounding.

The movie doesn't really have a ""plot"" or added interview filler - just great band performances with David Byrne's theatricality, lighting setups and projections and an extended cast of excellent touring musicians.",Stop Making Sense

5,"Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the exquisitely restored Jonathan Demme-directed Talking Heads concert film STOP MAKING SENSE is how it reminds us of how transcendent live music can be.  You won't see iPhones lifted in unison, nor will you see people scrambling to take photos at the front of stage in a frenzy to induce raging FOMO in their followers.

What you will see is a fantastic record of an iconic and innovative band, captured by a filmmaker that understood Talking Heads' unique performance styles & musical rhythms, and Spartan visual aesthetics. The end result is remarkably timeless and as impactful in 2023 as it was in 1984. 

Shot in 1983 on location at the Pantages Theater in Hollywood during their tour promoting the Speaking in Tongues album, the film would ultimately preserve what would be their final tour as a group.  Not seeing the band live remains one of my biggest regrets, but for anyone who cherishes them ‚Äì or is learning about them for the first time ‚Äì STOP MAKING SENSE is essential viewing.",Stop Making Sense

4,"Stop Making Sense, the concert film featuring Talking Heads, is considered by many to be one of the finest concert films, and justifiably so.  Director Jonathan Demme clearly understands what is important when filming a concert.  He doesn't fall into the MTV trap of head-spinning and disorienting short edits.  He doesn't waste time showing audience reactions.  He doesn't shoot the subjects from odd, pointless angles.  He doesn't squeeze in interviews with the bandmembers between songs. Like he did years later with Neil Young's Heart of Gold, Demme simply points the camera at the band and captures them making music.  The band is tight and are clearly having a good time.  David Byrne, as expected, is quirky and eccentric.  The setlist is thorough and the music is excellent.  The sound quality is fantastic.  For anyone who loves music and movies, this is a must see.",Stop Making Sense

4,"""Stop Making Sense"" is an enthralling experience.  It fuses the power of cinema and the power of music with bombastic symbiosis - it doesn't so much feel like a filmed concert as it does a symphony of pleasure, bursting from its photographic confines and grabbing us by the lapels.  
	It directs its focus onto the Talking Heads, a seminal New Wave group of the Roxy Music, David Bowie brand; most know them from such decade defining hits as ""Burning Down the House"" and ""Once in a Lifetime."" Their music feels more timeless than ever, the finger-licking idiosyncrasies of their musicality as much of the time as it is everlastingly fresh, as thrilling to listen to (and watch) as it was in the 1980s.  The film gives opportunity to see daring artists at their prime, to tap our toes and sing our hearts out.  We do more than sit passively.
	Fronted by magnetic eccentric David Byrne, the concert we are transported to in ""Stop Making Sense"" is not a single concert but three, three concerts filmed in 1983 and stitched together in the name of musical perfection.  The results are incredible.  The energy, musicianship, and production on display is invigorating.  Not a minute of its 88 are wasted.
	The concert itself builds like a movie - it seems destined for the celluloid.  It begins with Byrne walking out onto an empty stage, a stereo in one hand and a guitar in the other.  No spotlight frames him.  He looks like an amateur at an open mic night at a small town theatre, there to sing for his life.  Following is an acoustic, passionate rendition of ""Psycho Killer,"" its impact intact despite the lack of extraneous instruments.  Byrne is more than just your typical frontman.  He's a superstar, a showman.
	But the film is not just Byrne's time to shine.  With each succeeding song, he is additionally joined by the members of his band, the sounds in place layering until they reach the levels of a gut-punching rock concert.  Stage production grows increasingly complex with each song.  Vivacity seems eternal.  Everyone on display is having the time of their lives.
	As in the tradition of all good concerts, one doesn't have to be a fan of the Talking Heads to feel their hearts banging in their chests with excitement.  Byrne and his fellow musicians are masters who also happen to love their job, and their enthusiasm, combined with ""Stop Making Sense's"" visual and aural colors, makes for a rockumentary that manages, against all odds, to come alive.  Unlike ""The Last Waltz"" (1978), a similarly minded music doc of immense acclaim, there's never an atmosphere of staginess - ""The Last Waltz,"" despite its musical triumphs, is never intoxicating because we're distinctly aware that its subjects don't want to be there.  The direction, by Martin Scorsese, is flat, predictable.
	But ""Stop Making Sense"" is characterized by spirited verve, its central Talking Heads boundlessly kinetic, its director, Jonathan Demme, capturing their zest with vivid camerawork that makes us feel like a band member, an audience member, ourselves.  Byrne's vehemence is overwhelming.  Notable, too, are Tina Weymouth's slinky bass supplementations, and the presence of backup singers Lynn Mabry and Ednah Hult, who bring warm R&B textures to the setlist.  I especially liked the performances of ""Burning Down the House"" and ""Crosseyed and Painless,"" adrenaline infused tunes made better by the ebullient musicians behind them.  Byrne, of course, is a force of nature.
	After viewing ""Stop Making Sense,"" I suspect you might want to go out and purchase its live album of the same name, regardless of where your musical taste stands.   Represented in the film is artistic excellence, and wanting to relive its brilliance is expected.  I've listened to the LP three or four times in the days following my initial viewing, and my awe has hardly ceased.  Here is one of the finest concert films ever made.",Stop Making Sense

5,"I'm finding it too hard to review this on cinematic grounds without having all of my sentimental and nostalgic feelings influence my reaction.  But I think that's OK because this concert film by Talking Heads really meant a lot to me and thus deserves my highest rating.  Back in 1984, my friends and I saw this at Cinema 93 and danced in the aisles.  I bought the album with a special glossy book (now lost) in Hanover, NH (Dartmouth bookstore, I think) and later the cassette because it had remixes or longer versions of the songs.  When my high school had an ""air band"" contest, we got a ""big suit"" from my friend Todd's dad and created props (using the same design as was used in BBHS's production of ""Definitely Eric Geddis"") out of cardboard with white paint and black outlines -- guitar, keyboards, etc.  I played David Byrne.  We didn't win but got an honorable mention.  Talking Heads were/became my favorite band in those pre-college years.  Probably they went downhill after this album and watching this again last night, perhaps I wished for a few more early songs and not so much from Speaking in Tongues (but this was after all a film of the tour for that album). Having just read David Byrne's book (How Music Works), I can see more clearly than ever just how much careful thought went into the stage show for that tour and for the movie Stop Making Sense, directed by Jonathan Demme (who went on to Silence of the Lambs and more).   What's more, almost 30 years later, this still sounds great.",Stop Making Sense

Unlike typical concert films, this one is just pretty much continuous footage of this group performing their songs, including title tune, with no plot line what-so-ever. This maybe the best film from 1984. Tremendously riveting concert film that needs no additional storyline or corruption or background footage to succeed. The movie is essentially the members of the famous, unique rock band performing their songs, and wow, they are excellent performances.

5,"I was passionate about music long before I became passionate about film. It began when my neighbor played Hunky Dory to me, and became stronger through school as I discovered the likes of Pink Floyd, Neil Young, Joy Division, The Fall and too many punk bands to mention. We shared albums on cassette and I started listening to the John Peel show on the radio. He broadened my appreciation for obscure music. I mention this because Talking Heads were a big part of my musical education. I remember playing Fear of Music to death when it came out.

David Byrne is not a conventional singer. In fact, very few of the bands I love have people who can really sing. It's just not a requirement for me. I prefer vocalists who obviously feel what they are performing, even if their vocal ability is limited. A list of my favorites would include:

Ian Curtis - Joy Division
Neil Young
Stephen Malkmus - Pavement (can change key several times during a line)
Black Francis - Pixies
Tom Verlaine - Television
David Bowie
Kristin Hersh - Throwing Muses
Polly Harvey
Nick Cave
Thurston Moore/Kim Gordon/Lee Ranaldo - Sonic Youth
Kurt Cobain - Nirvana
Jonathan Richman - The Modern Lovers
Mark E. Smith - The Fall

Byrne whines, growls, yelps and screams. It works...for me. It may not work for everyone. The same goes for most people on the above list. That's why all those bands, and Talking Heads, don't sound like anyone else. They have their own identity. It amazes me that bands like Television don't get more recognition. Marquee Moon (arguably the best album of the 70s) is an absolute masterpiece of guitar sound, but they were labeled as punk/new wave and never got the recognition they deserved. I'm one of their 17 fans across the world.

Talking Heads deserve a special place in music history and the band was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Their sound isn't exactly rock, but what is it? There's a huge funk influence as well as world music.

The rhythm section was superb with Chris Frantz (drums), Jerry Harrison (guitar, keyboards) and Tina Weymouth (bass) all vital to the mix. For the purposes of this film, the band was joined by Bernie Worrell (keyboards), Steve Scales (percussion), Alex Weir (guitar), Edna Holt (backing vocals) and Lynn Mabry (backing vocals). The result was an intricate fusion of styles with multiple layers of sound. This complicated layering is prevalent among bands I have grown to love over the years.

The movie doesn't look like a movie at all; it looks like a live concert. It was filmed over several nights with cameras being positioned in different places each time. As a result, you won't see cameras cluttering the performance. It explains how we were given views of the audience from behind the drums without any other cameras in view. The shooting style is somewhat similar to that used in the dance scenes in Black Swan. You'll find yourself on stage with the band, right among the action.

The concert begins with David Byrne walking out carrying a boom box. He wants to play us a tape. It consists of the pounding backing beat of Psycho Killer and he performs it solo with his guitar. Tina Weymouth joins him for a rendition of Heaven, with Chris Frantz entering for Thank You For Sending Me An Angel and Jerry Harrison completing the foursome on Found A Job. The guest performers all add something to the sound and all nine performers are on stage for the start of the seventh song. I have seen Byrne use this formula for solo shows and it works well. I think it highlights what each musician adds to the sound and helps you appreciate exactly how much is going on in that rhythm section.

Byrne was a ball of energy, running on the spot, doing laps around the stage, leaping up beside the drums and performing a variety of patented moves. When the ensemble plays the Tom Tom Club's Genius of Love, Byrne leaves the stage. When it ends, he returns wearing the big suit. He wanted to make his head look smaller so he decided to make the rest of his body appear bigger. I think Byrne was one of the best front men in music history. Looking like a cross between a manic bird and Norman Bates, he was never still.

One of the gripes I have about popular music is that it's too manufactured. The record labels want a product that can be marketed and exploited. As long as those involved look the part, the music is secondary. That wasn't the case with Talking Heads. This was real. Look at their faces and how much they enjoyed the performance. Look at the effort involved.

The music is full of emotion.

There are 16 songs included in the 88 minutes:

1. Psycho Killer
2. Heaven
3. Thank You For Sending Me An Angel
4. Found A Job
5. Slippery People
6. Burning Down The House

Jonathan Demme's terrific direction blended with David Byrne's wild take on how to conceptualize the entire show makes for an engaging viewing experience all the way through.  This is a band that took the visual aesthetic seriously, not letting it mask the music but serve as an extension of it.  Lacking annoying MTV style quick cuts and using really cool lighting techniques to keep the group front and center.

Little to no audience shots means you get to see the musicians at work, sometimes seeing every note and chord progression being played up close, giving music freaks a chance to study the songs. And giving the rest of us fanatical or casual Talking Heads fans a great show and a great album that came from the film.",Stop Making Sense
5,My favourite live dvd,Stop Making Sense
4,"[i]That's[/i] how you do a concert movie. Fantastic Jordan Cronenweth cinematography, a great lineup of songs, all punctuated by David Byrne's wonderful buffoonery. ""Burning Down the House"" is an absolute corker. If only this amount of care and imagination were put into all concert films. And, heck, if only Jonathan Demme always made films this good.",Stop Making Sense
4,Now I better check out their albums...,Stop Making Sense
4,"I'm a huge Talking Heads fan, so I'm not sure how I wouldn't like this. I've seen a lot of concert films over the years, and I guess my only complaint would be that I expected a little more than just filming the concert. Which is a GREAT show, by the way. But I just feel like if you're going to do a concert film you need to add a little extra to it. Minor complaint to an otherwise fantastic show.",Stop Making Sense
4,"One of the greatest concert films ever. I first saw this years ago when it got its big anniversary re-release in an arthouse theater, where I saw it with people dancing in the aisles to Talking Heads music. It was a great movie-going experience.",Stop Making Sense
4,"There's a line in School of Rock where Jack Black talks about rock-and-roll being killed by ""a little thing called MTV"". The aesthetic sensibility of MTV (rapid cuts, flashy close-ups and rampant product placement) was at odds with the more elaborate, experimental end of rock which reached its peak in the 1970s. How ironic, then, that as said channel reached its peak, a concert film should come along which completely rejected the pop video aesthetic and redefined an entire genre.

Where Gimme Shelter and The Last Waltz captured the ends of their respective eras, Stop Making Sense is a showcase for Talking Heads at their artistic and musical peak. It is also the film which put Jonathan Demme on the map; seven years later, he would win five Oscars (including Best Director) for The Silence of the Lambs. But looking at the film twenty-six years on, there is something faintly elegiac about it. It contains none of the vapid self-promotion which has dogged more recent concert movies, from Shine a Light to Rattle and Hum.

For a film about looking at a group of musicians for ninety minutes, Stop Making Sense is surprisingly cine-literate. The opening credits, with its elongated blank-and-white font, is an obvious reference to Dr. Strangelove (fittingly, since they were designed by the same man). David Byrne's 'machine gun stagger' across the stage during 'Psycho Killer' is a nod to the death scene at the end of A Bout de Souffle.

More than that, though, the film is genuinely cinematic in a way that concert films very often aren't. Demme has always been an unfussy, understated director, and his camera is always keeping up with the players rather than the other way around. He possesses great technical know-how, knowing what to put the camera and how to shoot a performance so that the actors (or musicians) can just do their thing. Despite the level of meticulous planning that went into the tour, you get a real sense of kinetic energy existing on stage, something that a fussier director would quickly undermine.

Stop Making Sense is a showcase of Talking Heads at their very best, shortly after the release of Speaking In Tongues had brought them screaming into the mainstream. Their song-writing and musicianship is superb, producing a series of really catchy, rhythmical songs with ample room for improvisation. While later albums were dominated by David Byrne, here it feels like all four members are on the same page, working towards the same ends. But you don't have to be a fan of Talking Heads to understand just what makes this moment in their career so special.

For one thing, the film demonstrates a rare level of confidence and exuberance which is absent in so much of modern music (read closely, Lady Gaga: 'confidence' and 'shock value' are not the same thing). Normally it is considered anathema for stage crew and roadies to share the stage with performers, unless there was an urgent technical problem that needed attention. But in Stop Making Sense, the stage crew are on for much of the first half, moving around equipment in the middle of songs; the band play on regardless, and even bring them all on at the end as a thank-you gesture.

And then there is David Byrne, who in this film is confidence personified. Byrne has always been a charismatic front-man, but here he is positively hypnotic right from the opening. His jerky head moments, powerful voice and frenzied eyes lead you to focus only on him; during 'Psycho Killer', he holds the whole Pantages audience right in the palm of his hand. When he dances, his body moves like it's made out of plasticene, capable of being bent in all directions in perfect time to the music. His energetic repertoire ranges from doing laps of the stage being chased by a searchlight ('Life During Wartime') to cradling a lamp in his arms ('Na√Øve Melody (This Must Be The Place)'). And then there is 'the big suit', inspired by Japanese noh theatre, which is quite simply too cool for words.

The film contains a number of interesting creative decisions which both add to the impact of the concert and make the film more cinematic. Stage crew notwithstanding, the band come on one at a time, only reaching full strength during 'Burning Down The House'. This is a great decision because it highlights the individual talent of the musicians, and creates some form of narrative thread without resorting to pretentious prog rock narration.

Byrne was very keen that there be as few distractions on stage as possible, to focus both the performers and the audience. To this end there are no water bottles, which could reflect the light, and all the amplifiers and musical branding have been painted over in matte black. There is also no coloured lighting, with Demme and cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth using several interesting means to get around this. During 'Once In A Lifetime', Byrne is lit up while the rest of the band are in darkness, and in 'Girlfriend Is Better', a technician walks around with a portable light, steadily moving turning instrument (and the big suit) into a series of creepy shadows.

But the biggest innovation of Stop Making Sense comes in the relationship it strikes up between performers and audience. There are very few shots of the Pantages' crowd until the very last song of the show, and the recordings of their applause is turned down and pushed to the bottom of the mix. This makes the whole film feel incredibly intimate, like it's just you and the band having a long chat.

In something like U2-3D, the audience are put in the middle of a cheering crowd; their vision is obscured by waving hands and bobbing heads, and the experience is deeply claustrophobic. A show like this resembles an elaborate worship ceremony, with the band 'playing God' and inciting frenzied belief among those who have entered the temple. In Stop Making Sense, you still get the atmosphere, but everything is more settled and understated. While U2 fight to the last man for appreciation, Talking Heads know how good they are: they have nothing to prove, which means everyone can relax and just enjoy the music.

There are a couple of false notes which undermine the film's status as ""the Citizen Kane of the concert movies"". The first is the very common mistake of mismatched film and audio. Because the film was shot over three nights, there are a number of amusing continuity errors - for instance, Tina Weymouth's bass keeps changing colour. More troublingly, Chris Frantz will sometimes hit a cymbal, or a guitarist strike a chord, and no sound will come out. This is partly understandable given the arrangement of microphones, but for purists it can very be annoying.

The other issue is perhaps more petty, and that is the appearance of The Tom Tom Club, the spin-off band of Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz. Midway through the second half, they come on to perform 'Genius Of Love' while Byrne goes off to put on the suit. You can understand this decision logistically, but the song itself is quite weak. Tina Weymouth's natural range and calm delivery is at odds with the prominent funk percussion and Frantz' powerful backbeats; it's like the singer from The Party trying to compete with a Brazilian samba orchestra.

Despite these niggles, Stop Making Sense remains a remarkable piece of work, both for Demme and for Talking Heads. The fact that the band never toured again after this cements its status, and confirms its importance as a document of just how good they were. All of Demme's subsequent concert films, including the excellent Prairee Wind, owe a debt to this film, and it raised the bar for all concert movies to follow. Most of all, it proves the value of the music even to people indifferent towards the band, and for that feat alone it deserves the highest praise.",Stop Making Sense

Very revolutionary. Each song was a masterpiece of story-telling, mood, emotion, and filled with the vibrancy of youth. Loved the way each band member was given time to shine, except maybe Jerry Harrison, who, not-so-much. Still, it was the David Byrne concept from start-to-finish, save for the Tom Tom Club interlude, with Byrne getting incredible support from the rest of the team.

Jonathan Demme took Byrne's creativity, and transformed it into a true collaborative classic.",Stop Making Sense

4,"""...because it's good advice...""
says David Byrne to himself, (in his ""self-interview) in response to why the film is called STOP MAKING SENSE.
Indeed, why make sense in any sort of musical/performance sense? This is fun. 
The performers all throw themselves around the stage, not in the traditional, chaotic sense, but in a rather child-like, playful way, where you get up and run around simply because the music is fast and loud, where you flail your arms widly, not caring about what others think or not worrying about how badly you dance, where the lights don't obstruct the view and you can see everyone else, laughing and having a good time.
this is like some rock-concert-film utopia in retrospect. Everything is done right, in the most wonderful way. It's a toss whether this can be attributed to directo Jonathan Demme, or David Byrne, or the Talking Head's infectious energy. Maybe it's all of the above, because nothing works without the other. David Byrne understands this perfectly, allowing each performer to show off, show up one at a time as the concert goes on until the performance becomes a stylistic, dada-inspired surreal-fun fest. 
It's all rather gentle too, ironically. With a title like Stop Making Sense, there is a strange amount of ...cute-ness, for lack of a better word. I suppose the modern day equivalent (not anymore) would be dance/electronic group Deee-lite, or to a greater extent, the Japanese group Pizzicato Five. All these groups have in common that gentle, happy-go-lucky attitude in the face of everything, where words are ALMOST meaningless, but you can't help but say them and the bizarre instrumentations and sounds have a comforting familiarity. 
I think what truly separates this rock film from others, besides the unique persona of the Talking Heads, is the staging, which has more in common with a play, or even an art installation. It's not pretentious though, and not overtly clever either. It is fresh and still feels inventive now.
if anything, the film has aged REALLY well (helps that the music is great too. Talking Heads went out of their way to cherry pick the hits from their catalogue).
interesting story: Bernardo Bertolucci saw the film with David Byrne. Bertolucci noticed that near the end of the film, everyone started dancing in the movie theater. Bertolucci was enthralled and slightly jealous, stating that he wished people would do that at his films.
Coincidentally (or not), Bertolucci had Byrne help compose the soundtrack for his epic THE LAST EMPEROR. That film ended up sweeping the Academy Awards (including best original score). Bertolucci may not have gotten dancing movie-goers, but I suppose this is a fine substitute.",Stop Making Sense

I can count how many bands exceeded Talking Heads in terms of consistency, ambition, and influence in the 1980's with one hand. Stop Making Sense captures the funkiest white band in the world at a point where they have released classic after classic after classic, so there's a great wealth of amazing songs to pick from, and they got most everything you want as far as song selection. What's more is that they deviate greatly from the studio cuts, from an awesome, Byrne-only version of ""Psycho Killer"" to the full blown party atmosphere of ""Crosseyed And Painless"", the band is at their performing peak. The movie is shot pretty sparely, with some low-key flair at best, but it's still visually enthralling, from Byrne's giant suit to the strange projections to Tina Weymouth's signature undulations.

Leading a band whose mix of contemporary electro (for the time), sixties pop, african music and old school rock n roll is a vibrant joy.

4,"A well regarded concert film from The Talking Heads, directed by Jonathan Demme.  I like the Talking Heads, but I wouldn?t say I?m a huge fan.  I like a bunch of their songs, but I don?t listen to their albums all that often.   Their performance here is not bad at all, David Byrne has a lot of energy on stage, and it shows.  There?s a pretty simple formula most concert films follow, but this film ignores it.  Demme never cuts away to the audience and the audiences cheers are not as audible as they usually are.  More importantly he?s able to get the cameras really close to the performance.  The concert itself is not entirely conventional, it opens up on a bare stage when Byrne walks out with a boom box and acoustic guitar and does a stripped down solo performance of ?Psycho Killer.?  The rest of the band comes on one by one in the following songs and once everyone (including the backup singers, synth/keybord workers, and bongo players) shows up the back screen begins to be illuminated, later Byrne shows up in an oversized suit.  I?m not quite prepared to call it a performance for the ages, but this is definitely a really good concert flick.",Stop Making Sense

""Afghan Star"" follows four of the finalists, Hameed, Rafi, Lima and Setara, who is also the most outspoken of the group, on and off stage to get a sense of how the contest is affecting their own lives and any resistance they face.  Now, a singing competition might on the surface seem like a strange place to explore the changing state of freedoms in the country, but with any nation emerging from a repressive state, there has to be a first step(in this case, it is a dance step).  In other times and places, it has been artists like Elvis Presley and Pedro Almodovar that led the charge.  

So, while I agree with this moderately entertaining and insightful documentary that this television show where men and women occupy the same stage can lead to inspiring greater freedom, other conclusions concerning democracy and unity I am less sure of.  While the contestants do run political style campaigns, this really should not be confused with the ballot box.  Also, I bet that each ethnic group votes for their own primarily.",Afghan Star

4,"Afghan Star is a film posing as a documentary about a show called ""Afghan Star"" which is currently running in Afghanistan. But what the film really is about is the state of the country itself. The TV-show is just a way to really get to the more interesting and controvercial subjects.

There's a lot of talk in this film about how the so-called pop culture is forbidden in Afghanistan. In fact, commercial music was forbidden until the fall of the Taleban rule in 2001. However music and entertainment is still a very touchy issue because there are a lot of Taleban supporters still around and the interpretations people make out of the Qur'an differ radiaclly. Many people even think that dancing is forbidden by Allah because they believe it's His command. I'm not really in a position to talk about these things but what I can talk about is the film I just saw.

Afghan Star follows the lives of the 9 final contestants on a talent show called ""Afghan Star"". It's kind of like American Idol or X-Factor but with Arabic music. We follow the people through the controvercies and even death threats to find that the true freedom in their lives comes from music. As they say, it is not the politicians or the constant discussions that give these people the feeling of freedom, it is the ability to form your thoughts into a song which you can sing to the people. As it is said, The Afghan Star is the closest that the Afghan people have ever gotten to democracy.

The film also deals with entertainment in general in Afghanistan. A lot of people talk about how they have to hide the fact that they own computers or televisions from the Taleban fanatics who would probably kill them if they found out about it. The way it deals with these is people is what makes this film so powerful. These are real and normal people who can't speak out in a country which opresses their rights as human beings. This is their way of speaking out.

The whole film is well crafted and tasteful. It doesn't bring blame on anyone, it just deals with the facts. Most imporantly, this film is very interesting. There isn't a boring moment because you so rarely hear about these kinds of things. This is also a great learning experience as not everyone seems to understand that the people in the Middle-East are just the same as everyone else in the world. They worry about the same things and fight for the same rights.

This film was a delight! If you're at all interested in any of the things I've mentioned you should watch this film. It's not perfect but it's short and sweet and it deals with important issues. And even though you might hate the music it's still so much fun to listen to the contestants.",Afghan Star

Afghan Star is one of the first nationwide shows telecast across the entire country and it has apparently become a viewer's sensation!  Afghan Star focuses on five singing hopefuls in this American Idol-rippoff (which I am fine with).  The real show this is based upon, allows its viewers to elimated their least favorite singer each week in hopes of getting their favorite to the final for the title of Afghan Star.  I mean -- this is American Idol in Afghanistan so the singers since about things in Afghanistan (some of the subtitled lyrics made me laugh simply because my life doesn't relate to theirs) and there is NO dancing (one female constestant sings and dances upon her elimination and all hell breaks loose -- death threats and her family's lives are all put into danger as she is labeled a ""loose woman"").  The documentary is eye opening in many ways -- they show us flashbacks to Kabul in the 80s with a very liberal student population and imposes it alongside the Kabul of today -- staunchly repressed and sad and bombed to bits.  Afghanistan at one time could have become a tourist mecca; but with the arrival of the Taliban and other fringe groups it wasn't given the chance.  Afghan Star follows the contestants down to the winner so we get so see Afghanistans star of the moment ... and after being taken all over the safe parts of the counntry it is eye-opening seeing the different sects voting for members of OTHER sects!  AMAZING!  There has been some major opposition to this show (the Taliban thinks their cellphone votes are being tracked!!!) and its life after one season remains in doubt.  The shows producers pledges to continue on and it appears that there is a large portion of the population that will gladly and willlingly throw off some of the stricter Islamic rules pertaining to society.  Afghan Star was an interesting documentary for many reasons -- it dealt with fame, celebrity, music, religion, acceptance and un-acceptance, Afghan youth and Afghan elders, geography, the landscape of Kabul etc.  There as a lot here and it was told in an entertaining way.  I don't know if their will be an Afghan Star 2; but I wish them well if they try to take it on.  More power to 'em!",Afghan Star

It SEEMS a democratic debut for Afghanistan, prolly more so than the presidential election.  This docudrama builds a bridge of understanding towards a country,which all that was ever portrayed about in the media was war and the Talibans.  It depicts the aspirations of the different ethnic groups represented by each contestant.  It makes us realise that we r similar; each having dreams of a better future.  It only humbles us that the struggle some have to put up for the same dream might be twice as difficult given the harsh conditions.",Afghan Star

This documentary evokes a lot of different feelings at once, because as inspiring as it is to see part of the country and its people emerging from the Taliban's shadow, it is also shocking and sad to hear everyday people saying one of the contestants deserves to die for, god forbid, dancing on stage. On a lighter note, it was fun to watch the performances and see who would win.

Afghan people see this as a revolution breakthrough, they voted for their favorite so hard as to sell their car, not because they sang well, but they see a possibility of change.

Singing was outlawed under Taliban rule along with television, music, and dancing.  This new found freedom is new for most Afghans, but a threat still lingers.
You come to admire each contestant with their passion in the face of danger.  They risk their lives to sing on television, but it√¢¬Ä¬ôs hugely liberating for the Afghanistan people who√¢¬Ä¬ôve lived in deep repression for years.  For many Afghans this show represents their first taste of democracy where their able to vote through SMS on cell phones for their favorite contestants each night.   You come to know and embrace each character with their hopes, dreams, and fears.  The film takes an intimate look at each contestant as well as the Afghan people and their rapidly growing culture that is now touched with an amount of freedom they√¢¬Ä¬ôve never known before. 
A key scene comes when the young Afghan woman Setera gets eliminated.  She√¢¬Ä¬ôs allowed to perform one last song before leaving the show and her emotions get the better of her.  She sings beautifully but decides to dance along with her song.  A simple dance where she√¢¬Ä¬ôs barely taking a few steps here and there, but it√¢¬Ä¬ôs enough to provide a national scandal.  To sing is already controversial to many Afghans, but to dance is an outrage.  Her life is in eminent danger after her dance.  Many of us take for granted the freedoms we have in the USA because it√¢¬Ä¬ôs all we√¢¬Ä¬ôve ever known, but it comes with a price that needs to paid.  This film is wonderful and teaches us many lessons and reinforces some we subconsciously might already be aware of.  Music is universal and crosses all races and beliefs & it can bring a nation together.  10/10 from me.",Afghan Star

5,"I hesitate to the use the word 'inspirational', but this doco had me fighting back tears at the dehydrated end of a long haul flight.",Afghan Star
3,"great capture of how small yet starkly large the world is, this time in regards to pop culture. also shocking to learn how progressive afghans used to be. i hope setara and others like her keep dancing.",Afghan Star
5,"An execelent documentary that both highlights how far the peoples of Afghanistan have come from a fundamentalist dictatorship and also what problems must still be overcome.  Further, it enlightens to the fact that at one time afghanistan was, similar to Turkey, an up and coming industrial and modernizing state, until the wars that tore the land apart.  Overall if one can walk away with anything from this movie, it is a deeper understanding of the average Afghan's way of life and how that is changing.(p.s. anyone that gave this movie less than 70% most likely either don't understand what a documentary is, or are just trolling.)",Afghan Star
3,"MFF Flick #5: Fascinating and depressing documentary about Afghanistan's version of ""American Idol.""  The reality of daily life for Afghans is so incomprehensible to me as I sit in a movie theatre in Milwaukee, munching on popcorn.  The importance and significance of such a low-budget television show was so touching.  The idea that a show could not only entertain, but unite a nation - phenomenal.  Like any American reality show could have that much potential...",Afghan Star

3,"Blew my mind and made me feel so free. I mean, I can dance (even though it mostly just looks like I'm allergic to music) and sing without fear of being killed.",Afghan Star
5,"It really is an incredible documentary. Not only does it show the rebellion of music within a younger demographic, it also shows America the reality of what is hapenning in Afghanistan, and how the same young demographic wants to fight the religious, almost oppresive, rule on everyday life.",Afghan Star
4,"Saw it at a local film festival.  This movie truly shows the cultural clashes in Afghanistan, and, interestingly, the first exposure to democracy for a whole generation.  Although the documentary itself is not without flaws, and at times can even be confusing, it's a movie about HOPE, the hope of a nation that is trying to overcome years of Taliban rule.",Afghan Star

3,"Fascinating insight into modern Afghan culture - and, erm...pop culture.",Afghan Star
3,"Neither 'worst' nor 'awesome'. Perhaps meaningful to natives of these regions, but to my eyes (and ears), a dim second cousin twice removed from Slumdog. The implication that cellphone usage has brought democracy, whatever the heck that is, to a country decimated by war is laughable, if not disgusting. And, oh, the cute guy wins.",Afghan Star

3,"After watching this, I'm glad that I'm free to dance in public.  That's not the case in Afghanistan, as Afghan Star explains in brutal detail.  I really liked this movie, but wish that there were more clips of what the country was like before Taliban rule.  The one clip in the movie was a hint, but there needed to be more.  

I had no idea how ethnically diverse Afghanistan was and is, which explains some of the history's violent past, but also demonstrates how this Pop Idol tv show might bring divergent groups together.  Pretty powerful.",Afghan Star

3,"Even though I expected this to be chock-full of liberal-imperialism and rationalizations about how important it is to wage a war of 'liberation', that was rather down-played, or at least not made explicit. Nevertheless, the reality of life shown by Marking as it follows the lives and thoughts of various Afghans connected to the show is worthwhile to experience even if through a video-camera sitting half-way across the world.",Afghan Star

There are times I wish this doc dug deeper, and it has a tough time getting off the ground for the first twenty minutes, but it's certainly interesting ground to cover.",Afghan Star
3,A really good documentary about the Afghan version of American Idol.  In a country where a large part of the population still thinks that people shouldn't be allowed to dance and participating in a vote that helps select the winner it is an interesting view of the country,Afghan Star
4,"Interesting to see how a knock off of a western television show is made in a country with such strict laws regarding music, dance and even television in general make everything more difficult.  What I enjoyed seeing most was how some people live with the fear instead of backing down on their ""progressive"" ideas.  Americans need to be reminded how lucky we are and even what we are fighting for when we try to expand democracy.  They feel voting for a singer is exercising democracy, but also live with fear they can lose their favorite new tv show at the same time.",Afghan Star

3,"Solid, inspiring documentary about Afghanistan's first televised talent competition, a la ""American Idol,"" that for the first time brings music back to the country after Taliban rule and gathers performers from formerly adversarial ethnic groups in what is the first contact with democracy many young people have ever had.  What may be throwaway entertainment in America is a cultural watershed moment for a country casting off the bonds of tyranny.  Both hopeful and eye opening, ""Afghan Star"" may lack a driving suspense factor, but makes up for it with compelling human drama.",Afghan Star

3,Interesting but a bit dry in terms of the narrative.  The access that Havana Marking got was pretty amazing though.,Afghan Star
3,"Cleaves closely, if divertingly, to the established ""Spellbound"" template of tracking a handful of contestants as they compete for the show's $5,000 top prize... Marking very cannily uses the show as a pretext to get into the living rooms of those watching it, and test just how far the format's notional liberalism, bringing together as it does previously warring tribes, can push against decades of deep-rooted conservatism. When one contestant, Setara, takes off her headscarf and - zounds! - starts dancing, the reaction is immediate and outraged: ""She is a loose woman... she deserves to be killed!"" Eoghan Quigg, you sense, had it easy.",Afghan Star
3,"A little slow-going at times but not bad enough to put you to sleep.  Definitely had some funny points, and was moving at times as well.  Sometimes it was hard to read the subtitles fast enough, but the overall feel of the movie was honest and had impact.",Afghan Star
5,This movie was so good. Such a compelling portrait of western influence in Afghanistan. Like a whole season of American Idol with the women suffering under such strict rule that it makes you want to jump in the screen and transport these women to a place where they will be safe and can live their dreams.,Afghan Star
3,"Sundance Best of Documentary 2009 ... fascinating subject matter and compelling film. I'm not sure I totally agree with a few of the narrative decisions, but definitely worth seeing.",Afghan Star
2,Watched on the movie channel. Be warned this movie enacts statutory rape. The acting was decent but the plot and ending definitely could have been better. The whole time I was waiting for her to tell the trainer that she was pregnant with his baby and she was going to keep it. That would have made the ending better as she walked away because that would have been the end of his career.,Slalom
0,"Very arty, long shots of the girl's unhappy face, and from the start it was obvious this was going to be about sexual abuse. Seemed almost like it was going to be soft porn. I stopped watching after about half an hour, because it was so obvious what was going to happen, and the long ""atmospheric"" shots of the girl staring into space seemed artificial and self indulgent.",Slalom
3,"Uncomfortable watch, I struggled to process the movie as it happened.
The ending doesn't let you feel like you have a resolution. 
But maybe everything is the feeling the story teller wants to leave you with, then it is a masterpiece.",Slalom
3,"Powerful performance, and intimate coming-ofage / abouse-in-sport film. Also predictable and not too exciting.",Slalom
3,"When a high-strung, emotionally abusive trainer inappropriately seduces a 15-year-old skiing prodigy, the aim of grooming an aspiring champion becomes unexpectedly complicated for the young athlete as she struggles to sort out her feelings and priorities. As a vehicle for addressing an important social issue (especially in the sports world), ""Slalom"" hits all the right notes (albeit somewhat predictably at times), and it conveys its message in a release with fine acting, excellent skiing footage and beautiful cinematography of the French Alps. However, the film begins running out of steam (and direction) in the final act, with ""nuance"" being euphemistically passed off as a lack of defined focus. Director Charlene Favier shows much promise as an emerging filmmaker in this debut narrative feature, though, based on this work, it's apparent some refinement is in order for future projects.",Slalom
4,Revisits the real-life situation of male coaches grooming underage femal athletes within an alpine skiing framework; Abita and Renier are top notch,Slalom
5,Good movie where some of the Rotten Tomatoes Critics rate 10 out of 10.,Slalom
3,Awesome. Worth Watching,Slalom
0,"Creepy and stupid, this bland adaption of the classic ""Pinocchio"" story is weird, and not in a unique or entertaining way.",Pinocchio
4,"Pinocchio ( 2002) was a really good movie. It was really funny at points, and even thought Roberto Benenni was a older guy when he played Pinocchio, he did a wonderful job at doing everything in the movie.  Pinocchio (2002) is a very underrated movie. This movie is much better than people say it is. For critics, this movie got a 0%, and for the critics, this is one of the 10 worst movie ever. For the audience this movie got a 33 %. This movie needs higher rating. What a good remake.",Pinocchio
4,"A diferencia de la versi√≥n animada de Disney, esta adaptaci√≥n esta mas aferrada al relato original. Claro que a estas alturas es muy dif√≠cil poder opacar al cl√°sico animado que Disney nos trajo, pero aun as√≠ esta adaptaci√≥n merece tener algo de atenci√≥n a pesar de no haber recurrido a m√°s efectos especiales para crear una marioneta viviente o darle vida a otros personajes no humanos. Al menos las intenciones de Roberto Benigni fueron buenas. Claramente no es mejor que la versi√≥n animada de Disney, pero se aprecia que hayan intentado hacer una adaptaci√≥n m√°s aferrada al libro. Mi calificaci√≥n para esta pel√≠cula es un 8/10.",Pinocchio
2,"What, 0%? I can only think of it as a delightful and entertaining story by Roberto Benigni. But maybe that's because I don't see it as a Pinocchio story. How old is Benigni? And he is obviously a human being.",Pinocchio

1,"Roberto Benigni was not a good director for this film, does not have much comedy and can sometimes be unpleasant and uncomfortable",Pinocchio
4,"This is a labor of love for Roberto Benigni and you can feel it right from the start. although it's a very different version of Pinocchio, there is a charm in this film that has always fascinated me. It may not be for everyone but this is to me a beautiful comedian dell'arte type of films. The performances are exaggerated, lots of mim√©tisme and body language, it's a farce within the farce, a love letter to old school films done in studios with lavish photography, colors and costumes.
The film didn't do well at the box office and was huge disappointment to many fans of the director, i personally think it's a beautifully crafted film.",Pinocchio
5,"I think this movie has been excessively criticized by modern bigots and people who are too much used to Hollywood shit.
This is an interesting and entertaining movie, seen with the eyes of a child, not an adult.
Benigni is funny and sweet in his portrayal of Pinocchio, is a fablesque kind of movie, and people saying ""it's creepy if a 50 years old plays a child in a movie"" are the kind of modern bigots that I talk of.
What is creepy about portraying something that you are not? There is nothing even remotely sexual in the movie, so that critique especially is really stupid.
I give it 5 stars to counterbalance the excessive downvotes this title had. I think it's an ok and enjoyable movie, to see with your childs instead of those modern animations without a soul.",Pinocchio
0,I can't bear to watch it.,Pinocchio

1,"Who Remembers Carlo Collodi's Children's Novel ""Pinocchio""? The Story About The Misadventures Of A Wooden Puppet-Boy Named Pinocchio & His Father, A Woodcarver Named Geppetto. Well, I Can Say I Was Introduced To This Story Through Disney's 1940 Animated Take On Collodi's Book.

I Don't See Anyone 1st Being Exposed To This Adaptation Here! Roberto Benigni's 2002 Live Action Spin On The Classic Story, I'm Sure It Meant To Do Some Good, Is Just A Flat-Out Awful Experience! I Can't Believe How Bad This Movie Is! The English-Dub Of This Italian-Made ""Pinocchio"" Adaptation Released Through Miramax Just Shows Us The Same Repeated Formula Of Pinocchio Always Getting In Trouble & Never Learning Fucking Shit! It's Constant Noise, Whining, Bitching, Animal Cruelty (To Donkies), & Annoyance! I'm Sure Roberto Benigni Is Not To Blame, Even Though He Was Not At The Appropriate Age To Play The Role & He Doesn't Look Like A Puppet, & It's Certainly Not Miramax's Fault For The English Dub Either! I Also Can't Believe That This Is The Closest Resemblance To Collodi's Original Book Than Disney's Animated Classic Or Any Other Adaptation, Which To An Extent I Guess I'll Give Some Credit. But Still, This ""Pinocchio"" Film Is Gratingly Annoying In Any Language Regardless.

I Feel Bad For Roberto Benigni, I Feel Bad For The Actors In The Original Italian Version, & I Feel Bad For The Star-Studded Cast Who Appeared In This English Dub. Although This Film Is The Closest To Carlo Collodi's Novel, Roberto Benigni's ""Pinocchio"" Is Horribly Casted, Ear-Gratingly Annoying, Cruel, Unenjoyable, Unpleasant, & Very Very Painful!

1,I can't believe Roberto Benigni is in this movie...,Pinocchio
0,"Horrendous. Benigni shows no restraint as he, a fifty year old Italian man, plays Pinocchio, turns his emotions and actions up to eleven, hopping around the sets and other actors, unfettered, as he rightfully wins his Razzie Award for Worst Actor. His performance is enough to sink the movie, but it's topped with sloppy dubbing and terrible writing. Avoid this like the plague; rent the 1940 version instead.",Pinocchio
3,"I saw this film when it was released in 2002 and back then felt hugely disappointed by the film. After watching it again recently i realize how amazing this film is, as a visual experience. Benigni takes us on a journey into eternal questions about making the right choices and learning from our mistakes, in the form of a Comedia Dell""Arte type of film, very impressionistic and beautifully shot and lighten. This lavish and sumptuous modern take on the Pinocchio of Collodi , is a very interesting piece of film making and i really salute the efforts and work put in this film on a technical level. Filled with amazing performances from the cast, Benigni emerge once again as a man greater than life. It must absolutely b seen in original version with subtitles, each character has a such a specific tone of voice, the dubbing kills a lot of the charm. What a great film , marvelously produced and a great delight to watch. A real amazing art house film!",Pinocchio
1,"Benigni's follow up to the Oscar winner La Vita √© Bella is a disastrously expansive flick where everything is not measured well, everything is overwhelming and sometimes even laughable. Furthermore, Benigni as the young living marionette may have semed the right kind of bizarre casting a few years before the film was produced, but in 2002 it was already too late for him to play such a part.",Pinocchio
1,"Creepy, unfunny and just plain terrible.",Pinocchio
0,"Whatever Roberto Benigni was trying to achieve while doing this, I don't get it. Pinocchio is an unfunny, silly vanity project.",Pinocchio
4,"Ages before seeing Roberto Benigni's Pinnochio, I researched much of the depth into it without treading into discovering the story. 
First of all, analysing the original story is a key factor since its a given that the Walt Disney production of Pinocchio would have deviated from the story to make it more kid-friendly film, although I identified this without having the plot given away.
Also, if you view the original art based on the story Adventures of Pinocchio, you'll notice the fact that Pinocchio himself looks little like in the Disney version and Roberto Benigni actually is made to look much like Pinocchio himself based on the first ever artwork ever to have illustrated him by Enrico Mazzanti.
Lastly, the simple fact that people forget is that Pinocchio is a tale of a mischievous wooden creation that stemmed from Italy itself in 1883, and so successful film creator Roberto Benigni who is known for his comedic antics would be the ideal director of it and would make an interesting lead.
Essentially, I loved Life is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) so much that I wanted so badly to like Pinnochio, and I took many precautions to ensure I would enjoy Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio as best as I could, including watching it in Italian not to suffer at the hands of terrible dubbing, and to embrace it as Roberto Benigni intended.
Alas, it seems people were attempting to make me dislike this film. The only options were to view the film in French or English, and since the French dubbing sounded good I watched it in that. The dubbing really featured a great voice actor, although I'm sure it wouldn't be as good as Roberto Benigni himself. I turned it over to English for 5 seconds but turned it back after hearing the dubbing. No wonder people hated the American version of this movie. It takes less than 5 seconds to determine that the dubbing has been disastrous, because whoever dubbed over Roberto Benigni's voice has clearly not hit puberty yet. It deviates way too far from the character being portrayed, and if I had to watch the whole film with this dubbing I would strangle someone. The person to strangle isn't the person whoever the hell Breckin Meyer is, but whoever decided that his pre-pubescent voice was appropriately befitting to a character portrayed by Academy Award winner Roberto Benigni should be blacklisted. The dubbing in Pinocchio is so abysmal that its as if Lawrence of Arabia was dubbed so that every time T.E. Lawrence Spoke, he had Jar Jar Binx's voice. That is an immaculate way to describe how horrific the dubbing efforts were on Pinocchio. It's not worth finding out how despicable things could have been, but it goes to show how one thing to be altered for the sake of international viewers can ruin everything for everyone else.

Although the context the story is set in is rather complicated because Pinocchio is played by a 50 year old Italian man who looks nothing like he's made of wood, Roberto Benigni is absolutely perfect for the role. Watching Pinocchio I completely forgot that Pinocchio was played by an adult, because Roberto Begnini's comedic energy and giddiness that won him an Academy Award for giving the single greatest performance in the history of cinema in his masterpiece La Vita E Bella is on board again in Pinocchio and he plays it as if he's embodying Giorgio Cantarini, the boy who portrayed Guido Orifice's son Joshua in La Vita E Bella. He's the finest man in Italy to portray Pinocchio, but he directs it too. His directional skill makes Pinocchio a magical Italian extravaganza, a majestic fairytale full of colour and life which gives it the spark it needs to function. Pinocchio is one of the costliest films in Italian cinema, but Roberto Benigni puts all the money into the film's style to ensure it pays the tribute to Pinoccio that it really deserves, and regardless of how odd it seems. The production design and costumes are Academy Award worthy, and the visual effects are excellent. Truly, Pinocchio is a strongly directed and stylish wonder which overshadows the fact that its a 50 year old man playing a young puppet made of wood. If you watch Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio without the despicable English dubbing, you're a lot more likely to embrace it and embrace the undeniable love for Roberto Benigni which won him the Academy Award for best actor.
Frankly, American Film studios are the people to blame for Pinocchio's lack of success, and critical and commercial failure. Pinocchio may one day be viewed as a misunderstood masterpiece like Heaven's Gate is now, and I hope that day comes soon. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece at this point in time, but I'd call it a damn entertaining family film with magical energy and true heart put into it from Roberto Benigni, even through he's working on creating a live action version of a story about a puppet that came to life, nearly became a donkey and was eaten in the ocean. I learned a valuable lesson about being a good boy from Pinocchio, moreso than I could from any animated version, and you know if you walk out of a film with a good feeling, it was worth watching. That's what I got from Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio, and its utterly his finest work since La Vita E Bella. One of the reasons is because the darker side of the story is incorporated in well without being overly creepy 
Nicoletta Braschi was also as beautiful and sweet as ever, Carlo Giuffre was a great Gepetto and Peppe Barra was a good taking cricket. 
For a film maintaining a rating of 0%, I am fearless in saying I loved Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio and have learned plenty from it, with the main thing being that Roberto Benigni has still got it in him to entertain immensely, even when treading the tricky wire of such a complicated story.",Pinocchio

1,"The only nice things I can say about this production of PINOCCHIO is that it remains faithful to Collidi's original (which can be a backhanded compliment at best, as the book is much darker and more unpleasant) and that it looks very lavish; the set designs and the costumes are very beautiful and rich with detail.  Unfortunately, that isn't enough to give this PINOCCHIO a higher rating, as it still emerges as both a trainwreck and a major misfire for director Roberto Benigni.  The problems begin with having Benigni play the title character--expressive though he may be, he desperately fails to come across as convincing as a young boy, and ultimately makes the character more unlikeable.  (His wife, Nicoletta Braschi, fares no better as the Blue Fairy.)  The flaws are further exacerbated in the recut redubbed English version Miramax slapped this film on with--talented though the actors may be, their performances both fail to sync up with the mouth flaps and only succeed in making the movie laughable (Breckin Meyer's shockingly lifeless dubbing of Benigni is particularly dreadful).  Even in the original Italian language version, this PINOCCHIO really isn't that much better--it still has some terrible acting.  Fans of the now famous and better made Disney classic will be horrified, and even loyalists to the book are highly recommended to steer away from this disaster.",Pinocchio
2,"A visually impressive and dark telling of Pinocchio, but the dubbing job is terrible.  It doesn't help that a lot of the English version voices are very recognisable actors as this simply distracts the audience further.",Pinocchio
1,"It's difficult to determine what's more irritating: Roberto Benigni's annoying man-child performance (as well as all the other miscast players), the awful dubbing or the fact that it's shit...",Pinocchio

0,"Pinocchio was my favorite character when I was a little girl, but this movie ruined for me..  It was terrible.",Pinocchio
4,people say this movie was horrible but it was beautful. This was great family movie when i was a little boy i saw both the live action Pinocchio in 2002  and the old cartoon one. you know the story about a wooden puppet who must learn his ways before he turns into a donkey.,Pinocchio
1,"Avec ses decors lourdement baroques, ses costumes et ses trouvailles fantaisistes parfois audacieuses, on pourrait croire que ce Pinocchio a ete a l'ecole du cinema de Terry Gilliam.  D'ailleurs, le conte de Carlo Collodi aurait sans doute gagne a etre porte a l'ecran par ce dernier ! Depourvu de dynamique et de sens du recit, il se limite a peu de choses pres a un irritant one-man show autour de Roberto Benigni, acteur, scenariste, realisateur et principal clou au cercueil du film.  Dommage pour ce film qui possedait les moyens de ses ambitions et qui, malgre tout, ne merite sans doute pas sa place recurrente dans le classement des ""pires films de tous les temps""...",Pinocchio
0,"I was only six when I saw this but it vividly sticks out in my mind for being so horrific. Honest to God this film is terrfying, I'm sure everyone who saw this immediatly developed a fear of puppets. This film is just scary, period. Whoever had the bright idea to make a live action film out of Pinocchio was clearly insane.",Pinocchio
3,Great performance of Roberto Benigni. Playful yet slightly annoying as he plays as a child. I wish he was more adorable. Great scenes though!,Pinocchio

1,The dubbing is horrific - they shoould have left it in its Italian original with English subtitles. This film does not do justice to Roberto Beningni's incredible talent.,Pinocchio
3,I liked this. This followed more closely to the book than the Disney version that took too many liberties with the story.,Pinocchio
2,"This is not the Disney movie, but rather the 2002 Italian version made by Roberto Benigni.  This was savaged in its initial run because of the daft decision to release it in a dubbed version that didn?t even have Benigni doing the voice over.  I watched the subtitled version, but this really is still a pretty flawed movie without the dubbing.    To the movie?s credit, the production design is quite good and as a whole this is a good visual movie.  The story is meant to be a lot closer to the original book, which means there are a lot of, shall we say eccentric, bits of fairy tale silliness throughout.  There was something good to be salvaged here but what scuttles the movie is the decision to cast Benigni, a fifty year old man, in the title role; there?s just something creepy about that.  It also doesn?t help the Benigni does nothing to make it look like he?s made of wood.",Pinocchio
5,I loved this movie especially with Roberto Benigni. who is an amazing actor. I just loved him in Johnny Stecchino.,Pinocchio
1,"It gets one star because it was acually a very good film visually, and I laughed my ass off at it throughout (unintentionally). I watched the dubbed version because it was heralded as one of the worst movies of the decade. O yes. It is. A fifty year old man playing Pinocchio? The worst dubbing and voice acting I have ever heard. The translation from Italian was AWFUL. Lines like ""I wish I was alive, living."" or ""What's that log think he's doing. He can't think, he's a log!"" were hilariously awful. It slowly transcended from funny too just annoying after about an hour though. Breckin Meyer (who dubbed in english Pinocchio's voice) please kill yourself. You were the most annoying thing I have ever heard. Plus, it was just creepy in some points. A ton of awkward sexual chemistry everywhere and just donnt.",Pinocchio
5,"Did you guys at least know the actual story of Pinocchio?
Did anyone bothered with reading the novel before judging the movie?
Benigni's Pinocchio is the best rendering ever, faithfull in every line of every character to Collodi's novel.
Obviously if your term of comparison is the watered down disney versions of any fairy tale you are going to be disappointed quite often.",Pinocchio
3,"Quite average OK movie. I want to watch the original language version though. I believe the english dub over somehow fails to deliver and do justice to the movie. Roberto Benigni is Pinocchio. He is a puppet that comes to life. His father Geppetto (Carlo Giuffr√®) couldn't control him. He likes to play, tell lies, not go to school and naive. He was caught by a puppet circus giant but he tells a sad story and convince him to be let go. He even receive 5 gold pieces. Off Pinocchio wanting to go home but got tricked by the cat and the fox to go to a land and grow his gold. Met the blue fairy (Nicoletta Braschi) who told him not to lie and be a good boy. But he just wouldn't keep still. Went to jail and got to know a boy Lucignolo who became his best friend. Released when the king bore a son. Was given another chance by the fairy but he want to invite his best friend to the party. Instead got attracted to where he is going where it is a fun place and never ever need to go school. In fact it is a place where the youngsters turn into donkeys the next day. Pinocchio turn weak after performing some stunts and was thrown into the sea. The fairy turns him back but he got swallow by a big fish. Inside he met his father and they managed to escape. Pinocchio promise to work hard at a farm and nurse his father back to good health. He keep his promise this time and became a real boy, goes to school too.",Pinocchio

0,"Pinocchio is played by an ancient old man in this unintensionally disturbing Benigni remake in 2002. Nobody told the guy that if he's an old man he cannot play a little boy, much less one made of wood who becomes a boy. Wow. Just horrid.",Pinocchio
4,Benigni brings his creativity to a classic Italian tale making it much deeper as a story compared to the Walt Disney version that we all believe to be the original. Great!,Pinocchio

4,"First off, I watched this movie in it's original Italian form with English subtitles-it's the only way to go. Now, I've read so many reviews of people complaining about this movie because they thought Roberto Benigni playing the role of a little boy puppet was just wrong and disturbing, but to them I say, have you no imagination? I thought he was perfectly cast and did such a wonderful job portraying the innocence, charm and youth of a young child. He was very mischevious and fun and I loved every bit of his role in this movie and I loved every bit of this movie, in general. A great adapation!",Pinocchio

4,I think this was more theatrical movie about the original book. Perfect results.,Pinocchio
4,"Underrated. Unusually  faithful adaptation of the classic story.  Done in a very stylized almost theatrical manner that I think is quite misunderstood.  Just don't watch the dubbed version. BTW, if you read the original book you'll realize that Pinocchio is supposed to annoying and obnoxious (at least until the end of the story).  Whether this is beneficial to the book or movie is a matter of opinion, but it doesn't bother me.",Pinocchio

4,"This is a good-ass movie!!! Way better than the Disney version and more truer to the original story book. It's too bad a lot of people can't use their imaginations and see past the fact that Benigni is not a kid. He is really playing a puppet not a child anyways.  Nicoletta Braschi is beautiful as always and the two have good chemistry on screen. Watch the Italian version as the dub makes it look dumb. I dont know why he didnt do it himself.   I think American audiences have been corrupted by the Disney version of Pinocchio which is not like the book really. In the book, Pinocchio is not a good boy tempted. He is a naughty, naughty boy who has no sense of self control whatsover which benigni portrays very well.",Pinocchio

Benigni in the part of Pinocchio is sometimes irritating the way a child can be irritating.

0,"Why, Roberto Benigni... Why???",Pinocchio
0,This is without a dobut the best example of why films shouldn't be dubbed over. It's one thing to completly miscast a film. (At 50 Roberto Benigni should have figured out that he maybe wrong for the role.) But it's the painfully dull voice work of Breckin Meyer that makes this a diaster cause of course why would audiences want to read at the movies? Maybe because that may the magic of the performances and power of the filmmaking doesn't get ruined by dumbasses.,Pinocchio
2,"Not as bad as everyone has made it out to be (the version I watched was the original Italian subtitled version, not the English dubbed version which I hear is terrible) but compared to Disney's classic animated masterpiece of the same story, it lacks any magic or wonderment. Also co-writer/director/star Roberto Benigni (who was terrific in ""Life is Beautiful"") is really annoying as the title character and the film's length is too overlong. However the performances from the supporting cast were good, the production/costume design was nicely done and the cinematography is beautiful. This will be one of those films that you will either really like or really hate, personally I that it was okay.",Pinocchio

4,"It's a good charming, sentimental, low key movie. Decent music but not used enough and can be a bit dry at points. The acting is decent but the main issue is Mac & his friend don't have much charisma and just kind of blend in somewhat. There isn't many characters aside from the villagers and Gordon so it doesn't get in the way of anything but they don't have the presence of Lancaster who is the best actor in this even though he doesn't get much time. Also while this is a solid paced and edited film in the middle it can tend to drift a little bit and events just sort of happen as we jump between our two main leads but it does follow a loose enough flow of events and character progression. The last 20 minutes especially once we focus on Ben things start to recover and it gets interesting and really charming and wraps up well. I was surprised how everyone had a defined character arc also. The best thing is the cinematography with amazing sweeping shots of the environment and great camerawork. The setting is really memorable also. The main issue is as beautifully done as the shots are it doesn't pop oddly enough. I think part of that is because of the abrupt cuts and the greyish/dark colors taking a second to notice but its still really well done. I think slower merge transitions would've worked better. This is a solid low key gem though that anyone who is a fan of any actors in this, the director, or 80's dramas will like.",Local Hero

5,"Peter Riegert gives his standard low-key performance in a film that takes up the beauty of the Scottish coast, warts and all. The film stands the conventional take on Big Bad Oil coming in and destroying the idyllic seaside on its head. Today, rather than taking a savvy what's-in-it-for-me attitude, the residents of the town would be devastated and angry in their unified response to being bought out. But, this was the early 80's and the film doesn't reach for the rallying flag. That gives the film some suspense to its direction.",Local Hero
3,"Local Hero is an enjoyable enough offering from Scottish director Bill Forsythe, a movie that can be best described as nice.  The characters are all nice, the story and the moral are both very nice, the locations are nice, and the performances are all quite nice, as well.  The premise?  A young American oil executive (Peter Riegert) travels to a quaint coastal village in Scotland with the intent of purchasing the land in order to build a refinery, quickly learning that not everything has a price.  Despite all of its niceness, there are a few faults.  Mark Knoepfler's score, for the most part, is dated 80s kitsch, the white noise in the interior scenes is weirdly loud and distracting, there are a handful of scenes that feel like unnecessary baggage, and the story is a bit predictable.  But it's still a very nice movie.",Local Hero

4,"Burt Lancaster, yes. I love how he, Mr. Happer, is sleeping during the business meeting. Happer seems to be very intrigued by space and constellations. My question is why? Bill Forsyth's humor is pretty particular. McIntyre seems to be somewhat of a materialistic guy - talking about his Porsche and seeing all the high tech gadgets he owns. I can't believe they're trying to turn the bay of this Scottish town into an oil refinery. The little bunny cleaning itself was really cute. That panning landscape shot of the beach line was beautiful. Those peach, purple and pink colors were incredible. One could make a painting out of it. 

How can they be so oblivious to the beauty of that Scottish beach? It's almost like they're choosing to ignore it so they don't have second guesses about destroying it. I love how the phone booth overlooks the beach line. How could you even consider thinking about destroying that beach and replacing it with a nasty oil refinery? But at the same time I understand that oil is needed in order to make certain things that we use in our day to day lives, so its a tricky thing. What is the deal with Happer's therapist Moritz? The man is like an annoying cartoon. 

I like how quaint that little Scottish town is and how likable and down to Earth all the townspeople are. It's really wholesome seeing how comfortable and accustomed McIntyre and Olsen have become with being in the town. McIntyre strolling along the beach collecting seashells and Olsen becoming enamored with the pretty marine biologist girl. It's like one of those foreign but familiar experiences that you never forget and one of those quaint little towns that you never want to leave.

The movie definitely has that 80's style of humor that we've come to love. It's not really a hilarious laugh out loud kind of movie, it's more low key and subtle. It does have a really pleasant charm about it though, it's definitely a charming and witty movie. All the shots of the beach and nature are very enchanting. Makes me want to go visit Scotland. The movie's not anything amazing or thrilling or exciting, but it's a nice little piece of cinema. Honestly the best part of the movie are the shots of the beach and the Scottish landscape. Local Hero is one big charming homage and love-letter that pays respect to the writer/director's homeland of Scotland. Overall I liked it, it was a good movie but I don't think I'd be watching it again.",Local Hero
5,"My all-time favorite film.  I must have seen it around two dozen times by now.  A beautiful, special little movie.  Every performance, every scene, every little bit of throw-away dialogue.  Scottish director Bill Forsyth's best effort, though Gregory's Girl and Comfort and Joy are fun little films as well.",Local Hero

3,"If you are looking for a slow moving movie to relax with ,that includes a Scottish Seaside this is a film that might grow on you. As for me I was less impressed with the picture quality and grittiness. Where the storyline is quite beautiful and moving in some ways most of it felt staged and manipulated. The big town company wanting to buy out the small-town localist is a story used all too many times throughout the years. The music featured by Mark Knopfler is a perfect choice that deserve many star ratings.Overall I would have preferred a different time period that wasn't painfully 70's quality with a more authentic cast. As for the old man Ben ,Burt Lancaster and lady Marina they were perfect for their roles.
 Sadly I can't give a full 5 star rating because the ending also left me dissatisfied. It just felt there was alot that could have been different to make this a better movie. But thats just my opinion.",Local Hero
5,"A home painfully far away from home; that place that you wistfully return to when caught in a daydream, where all of the sights and sounds envelop you in a tender and familiar embrace. The harsh reverberation that accompanies awakening from that dream, potentially evoking nostalgic despair if not for the realization that the world of dreams will ever remain accessible to you in your time of deepest need. ""Local Hero"" paints a picture of such a home for the wandering soul, where a quiet form of heaven occupies the heart even when the body is elsewhere. The film will leave you with an aching desire to return to it again and again.",Local Hero
3,"Nice shots of the Scottish cost. Otherwise, it's just a mildly entertaining snippet of life in another place and another time, and that's nice enough for a passing grade. Some moments are sweet and a little funny but rarely enough to properly laugh. Some moments are interesting enough to keep you watching. The acting and directing are good. Overall I think this film is too highly rated. I'm a little disappointed as I hoped it would funnier or more heart-warming but it was nothing more than mildly entertaining.",Local Hero
4,"Charming, funny, brilliant!",Local Hero
5,"I once wrote a review of Local Hero called 'The local hero pyramid'. Ever since I saw it in the 1980's for the first time, it is movie to measure other movies against. Bill Forsyth has the talent to take a plot that could easily become a court drama, action thriller or over the top comedy, and makes it about people, about boredom in a small fishing village, about human nature and mysteries that keep a community together. And then there's Burt Lancaster in his prime.",Local Hero
5,"The dated feel, slow start and lack of anything to greatly engage with at the start never fails to lull me into a false sense of ease before I'm engaged with the minor characters, sympathise with Mac and in awe of of the scenery.

This film slowly works you into a strange feeling of suspense and awe. The characters are charming and funny, gentle and witty. Every time I see a red phone box I think of this film.",Local Hero
5,The perfect movie and soundtrack,Local Hero
2,"Local Hero is cute. It isn't riveting or involving, it's just very...nice. And when it comes to playing it safe in films, a sweet story will usually grab me along with an assorted cast of characters that are both likable and unlikable. After finally seeing Local Hero on the Criterion Channel and all the years of hype, it was just that: a bit of a charmer with some interesting characters but totally forgettable. Mark Knopfler's score was definitely the highlight.",Local Hero
4,"A quality film that plays on classic Scottish film structure (a la Whiskey Galore) - a small, insular community that is confronted by an outside entity, but flipped so that the foreign perspective becomes the focus, and the Scots are all to happy to leave. The film really succeeds in establishing itself in a series of relatively small moments rather than drawing in the audience through the overarching narrative; the relationship between the wonderfully eccentric Happer (portrayed hilariously by Lancaster) and his incresingly obsessed therapist plays virtually no role in the larger story but is incredibly funny. Furthermore, the collective Scottish reactions to the events of the film form so many tiny moments of humor with characters that feature in virtually no other scenes. A wonderfully '80s flair (Riegert is the prototypical corporate ladder climber) and some heart only add to the classic combination of this neat little comedy. (4/5)",Local Hero

2,"The story was potentially cute but the first thing that jumped out at me was how sexist the movie was. Women's roles, even that of the marine biologist, was reduced to being love or sex objects.  The head of the company was a man.  All the main characters were men. Even the dance scene showed a large band with no women musicians.  The women had menial jobs and were controlled by men. Men made all the decisions, and, in the end, a male simpleton made the case for continuing the scientific work of the highly degreed marine biologist (bc he had an erotic interest in her). She was apparently either too weak or to preoccupied with showing off her body in a swimsuit to worry about such things as her own research. The movie was insulting.",Local Hero

The setting, a seaside village in Scotland is the true star, but Peter Riegert, Denis Lawson and Burt Lancaster are great co-stars.  As is Mark Knopfler's subtle, supple soundtrack.  Everything about the film is understated, quintessentially Scottish.  The tale, of an American oil company come to buy out an ancient Scottish village is also reminiscent of the story of the evacuation of St. Kilda, poignant and hopeful, all at once.",Local Hero

4,"Understated without being underwhelming, the joy of the movie relies as much on the cast of whimsical characters and wry nonsense dialogue as it does Forsyth's subtle, unhurried mood. Underlying the deceptively relaxed and simple plot are evergreen (but especially prescient today) themes of environmentalism, anti-capitalism, and globalization, but these are so casually (and, narratively, causatively) layered into the film as to both be undeniable and unnoticeable.",Local Hero
5,"My all time favorite film.  Along with Star Wars, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Blade Runner(s), Rushmore ... it moved me.  The script, actors, and acting were sublime.

0,"Local Hero is one of the most scatterbrained, poorly scripted, and utterly useless movies I've ever seen. It's the story of a guy who travels to a small Scottish village to buy their village for his oil company, but also while he's there he has a directive from his boss to look for a comet in the sky. Yes, as insanely unrelated as that last part sounds it felt 3 times more odd while watching the film. And, strangely enough, that's not even the weirdest thing going on in this movie. Yet, Local Hero is not presented as some farcical comedy, they seem to be playing it straight. Also there's a whole storyline about how the guy who came out to this village starts to grow attached to it for no real reason that we can see. Not to mention how he falls in love with the innkeeper's wife out of nowhere. I'm completely stymied trying to make a logical argument out of why this movie didn't work, but for me it was literally every single aspect that failed. It wasn't funny, it wasn't touching, the acting was bad, the plot made no sense, and the resolution was frustrating and pointless. Also the final resolution only made 3 people in the entire film happy, so really one could argue it was a sad ending. HATE is not a word I like to use that often for movies, I reserve it for really annoying or painful movie-viewing experiences. Local Hero was one of those experiences. It's so bland and dull in the tone and pace that I'm surprised it was even able to elicit this kind of ire from me, but it was just so lazy and poorly-executed that I wanted to scream. I'm surprised I even made it to the end.",Local Hero

3,"A simple little story that has charm, heart and originality. Nothing much happens but its quirky nature is appealing and the characters are all memorable. The moments that Forsyth focuses on are always free from cliche. In the end it's not as personally impact-full as Housekeeping but the film did make a fairly large cultural impact due to its pro-environment message. It's one of the first film to tap into the ""Go Green"" message that would become popular in the 90's. Actually, considering when the film came out, it had guts to go against the obsession with commerce. It also has a memorable score by Mark Knopfler and helped make Scotland a tourist attraction.",Local Hero

4,I simply adore this movie. I love to think that there are idealic places left in the world populated by quirky people.,Local Hero
3,"Well, Peter Riegert may not be you're friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, but I reckon he'll have to do as a conveniently placed hero. ""They make us boss, the devil pays off, and them folks that are real hard up, they get their local hero, somebody with the right style! They get their local hero, somebody with just the right smile!"" Forget Bruce Springsteen, or at least his studio stuff (Hey, say what you will, or rather, what you should about his recordings, but he puts on a heck of a live show), because the real '80s rock star who we should be talking about here is Mark Knopfler, and if you're wondering who that is, first off, forget you, and secondly, why, he's a Sultan... he is a Sultan of Swing... who wants his MTV... and scored this film. Yeah, he wasn't exactly pretty enough to make it as a household name of a superstar guitarist, but, as he would put it, ""yeah, the boy can play"", and with his fingers no less, and can also put together a pretty good film score (I guess you could say that he is ""Making Movie Scores""... if you get what I'm referring to), which is good, because not a whole lot of people kept up with him after Dire Straits. I don't know why, because I can't think of anyone else in the band, as awesome as it was, unless, of course, people either forgot his name, due, of course, to his not being pretty enough make it as a household name of a superstar guitarist, or couldn't figure out how to pronounce his name when they tried to ask a clerk for his solo CD. No, he wasn't that unsuccessful as a solo artist, but let us still remember him for his work, even in this film, whose score isn't its only aspect that's enjoyable, even if it can't quite overshadow problems.

Something that I admittedly did not expect from this film was its being as slow as it is, for although I wasn't exactly walking into this British comedy expecting all that much liveliness, and although the final product rarely, if ever blands things up so much that it downright bores, the atmosphere is much too cold much too often, being flavored up by anything from sharp humor to spirited score work, but nonetheless dulled down by its neglect to build up all that much atmospheric momentum. The film limps along, not simply more than I expected, but more than it should, letting your investment slip, time and again, and ultimately proving to be a crushing blow to the enjoyability of this generally decent film, at least when it backs story structuring that is just as limp. It could perhaps be the atmospheric slowness emphasizing lower points in plotting momentum, but whether we're looking at atmospheric issues or issues that were on paper to begin with, this nearly two-hour, kind of minimalist comedy outstays its welcome with excess material that sometimes goes so far as to descend into needless subplots, often comes off as nothing more than filler, and consistently stands as little more than mere fat around the edges that drag out a film that is limp enough in atmosphere. There are enough high points to Bill Forsyth's script for storytelling to not fall too flat, but the final product feels pretty repetitious because of its tendency to drag its feet, both on paper and in directorial execution, and such repetition quickly devolves into aimlessness when all of the slow spells provide you with time to meditate upon how there's really not much to this story. There's certainly enough meat on the bones of this story concept for a reasonable degree of intrigue to be sustained, occasionally augmented by relative heights in spirit, but on the whole, we're looking at a generally do-little plot with limited consequence and a whole lot of room for dragging that this film has no trouble filling. The film has its high points, but between them is a film with only so many flaws, but ones that prove to be potent enough for the final product to slip into bland aimlessness that meanders along, disengaging you enough for memorability in this film to go shaken by underwhelmingness. That being said, while the film is hardly as lively as it could have been, the patient can expect to find a film that is still well-crafted enough to stand firmly secured as decent, with charm, heart and, of course, a pretty soundtrack.

Mark Knopfler's first experiment with film soundtrack composing, this flick boasts a score that isn't terribly spirited, or even all that used, so don't at all go in expecting something as rich as, say, the then-relatively new ""Telegraph Road"" (I bring that song up, in spite of its typically not being all that talked about, because it is more-or-less amazing), but do expect Knopfler's first venture into the world of film scoring to be a fairly worthwhile one, with a distinct steadier and warmer type of Dire Straits flavor - anchored by Knopfler's tastefully sharp guitar work - that both entertains and adds to the warmly thoughtful heart of this meditative charmer. Knopfler's efforts may sometimes fall into formulaic score sensibilities for the '80s, but on the whole, enough is refreshing about this soundtrack to augment what liveliness there is within this film, whose liveliness must first be established before it can be augmented. Well, sure enough, no matter how much Bill Forsyth's story structuring limps out, when the script picks up, it helps in keeping you going, largely through humor that may sometimes be too dry to be all that especially effective, but is generally very amusing in its marrying relative silliness with wit in order to craft colorful dialogue and visual jokes that range from amusing, to very funny. If nothing else is colorful about Forsyth's script, it is, to a certain degree, the characterization that may be hurt by expository shortcomings throughout the final product, but proves colorful enough for your investment in the characters who drive this film to be attracted, then truly secured by the color within the charismatic portrayals of the characters. Most everyone in this cast charms, to one degree or another, with our leads being particularly charismatic, especially when such charisma bonds through chemistry that helps in giving the film rather human touches that further color up the endearing heart of this film that would still not be what it ultimately is without the efforts of Forsyth, as director. I wish I could say that Forsyth's atmosphere is nearly as lively as it perhaps could have been, because liveliness would have reinforced the kind of entertainment value that could potentially take a very heavy load off of the shoulders of this film, which would not necessarily be truly rewarding with less bland spells, but would certainly take on more of the punch that you still get enough glimpses of to be adequately engaged, as Forsyth, through all of his directorial flaws, goes into this project with palpable inspiration that intensifies the charming aspects - of which there plenty - as endearing and kind of effective. The film stands to entertain, or at least engage more, and would have been as entertaining as it probably should be if more effort was put into liveliness, but when it's all over and done with, the charm and heart of the film endears, while the sharp humor, performances and high points in storytelling help in securing the final product as decent, in spite of its leaving much to be desired.

Bottom line, atmospheric limp spells lay blows to a momentum that is hurt enough by the repetitious dragging that joins with natural shortcomings in story concept to form aimlessness that leaves the final product to meander its way into underwhelmingness, but no further, as there is enough sharpness to Mark Knopfler's score, effectiveness to the humor, and charm the performances, both on and off of the screen, for ""Local Hero"" to go padded as heavily flawed, but endearing enough to stand as enjoyably decent.

4,"This is one of my all-time favourite comedies; not only for the gentle understated script, but also for the beautiful haunting score by Mark Knopfler. It picked a few awards in its time, amongst them, Bill Forsyth won the 1984 BAFTA for Best Direction and Mark Knopfler was nominated for Best Score. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.

Knox Oil in Houston, Texas is exploring for oil in the North Sea and need a site for a new refinery. A stretch of coastline is selected but it is inhabited and so they send young executive MacIntyre out to make a deal with the locals. It seems the locals already know he is coming and are keen to make a deal. The local accountant Gordon Urquhart agrees to liaison with the villagers leaving MacIntyre to enjoy the scenery. Over time he falls in love with the place, but knows he's there to do a job. With agreement looming they hit a sticking point when they discover that the beach is owned by the local beachcomber, Ben. Unable to persuade him, MacIntyre's boss, Felix Happer arrives to conclude matters. Could this mean the end for the  beautiful fishing village, or is there another twist in the tale? Of course I'm not going to tell you here or them Spoiler Police will be taking me for a ride in a boat.

This is the first time I've watched this with a view to reviewing it and, I must say, I found the script much more subtle than I had noticed before. Apart from the obvious comic elements, I got much more out of it this time around. Great performances all round; Peter Riegert did a good job as MacIntyre, as did Denis Lawson as Gordon Urquhart. I should also mention Burt Lancaster, who did a sterling job as Felix Happer and Fulton Mackay who was really great as Ben. And finally, an early role for a young Peter Capaldi as Danny Oldsen, better known these days for his role in the TV series The Thick of It, and the 2009 film, In the Loop. There are many others I would like to mention, but I would be here all day if I did.

It does look a little dated and it's very obvious there wasn't much of a budget to play with after Mr Lancaster had been paid. But even so, it's still a fine piece of work and one I would be very happy to watch several more times in years to come. It's interesting to watch MacIntyre and how his appearance subtly changes throughout the film, I love that way that was done. But enough of my prattlings, I think you've probably already guessed... Recommended.

My Score: 8.6/10

Burt Lancaster is his boss, and Denis Lawson (Wedge Antilles from ""Star Wars""/Ewan McGregor's uncle) is the local innkeeper.  

Maybe some people would find it too twee, with its touches of magical realism (there is a possible mermaid) and quirky small town characters, but I find it completely perfect, and by the ending, I am filled with happy/sad.  *Swoon*",Local Hero

4,"I really cannot praise Local Hero enough; it is simply one of the best films ever made and certainly, without any shadow of doubt, my number one favourite movie of all time. Fans of Ealing Comedy will relate to this film instantly. The humour is extremely subtle, going for the quirkiness of human behaviour rather than prefabricated belly-laughs. For example, the two farmers arguing which is the better vehicle for transporting winter lambs, Massarati or Rolls Royce. And the African preacher who has to explain that he's ""not Scottish either"" but still has the surname McPhearson. At first glance, the story of Local Hero is hardly one which would engage fevered interest. A big Texan oil company wants to buy a huge chunk of Scottish coastline and a representative is flown over to close the deal. Chosen because it's thought he is of Scottish origin, McIntyre (Peter Riegert) complains to a colleague that he could do the deal over the wires in an afternoon and that his parents chose the surname when they got off the boat from Hungary because they thought it sounded American. But what grabs the attention and is the fundamental beauty to the film is ""Mac's"" journey from a materialistic Texan yuppie to one who falls in love with the simple things of life and by the film's end, when Mac returns home, has been changed forever by his trip.

Mac plays his part very well from a character who depends on his expensive suits, his Porsche, quad hi-fi and personal health insurance to one who collects shells on a Scottish beach and drinks 40 year-old malt whisky in the bosom of the small community that he suddenly finds himself a part of. Burt Lancaster plays the wonderfully eccentric oil company CEO who is more concerned with dicovering a comet of his own than making millions of dollars. Then of course there is Denis Lawson as the estate agent / taxi driver / hotelier, Peter Capaldi as the bungling company trainee and Jenny Seagrove who prefers being underwater to life on land, along with all the various yokels and locals that give this film its very unique charm. And the plot twist? A fabulously subtle one-liner that gives the whole thing away. But of course, one cannot talk about this movie without mentioning the soundtrack. Many years ago I felt compelled to watch this movie because (being a big Dire Straits fan at the time) i had the soundtrack and was instantly hooked. Mark Knopfler does sterling work in adding musical flavour to the film. Lazy acoustic guitars match perfectly the breath-taking scenary that the director, Bill Forsyth, has captured of the Scottish Highlands. Overall, I would have no hesitation in recommending this film to people. Every recommendation I've made has been met with the same response: a gem of a movie that simply cannot be ignored. Local Hero will be my own personal number one for ever!",Local Hero

3,"A slight comedy-drama about a Texan oil representative who is sent to a small Scottish coastal village to smoothly broker a deal to buy their land from them to build a new oil terminal. Surprisingly it isn't a locals vs. the corporation film, indeed the locals are only too happy to be given millions. On the surface it is a light, enjoyable comedy (with a few less successful and unnecessary attempts at broader comedy, in the US set scenes particularly) but dig deeper and there is more than a streak of cynicism. The locals are greedy, the developer learns (conveniently) to love the magnificent, majesty of the area only to be shipped straight back to dirty Houston and the whole finale rests on the odd whims of a rich old man. Good, but Ealing did this better...",Local Hero
5,amazin film about a northern american oil company tryin to get oil out a scottish town.,Local Hero
4,"A very funny and finely-observed film about what life in remote Scotland is really like (as distinct from one's romantic notions). If you're paying attention, it has some of the most memorable scenes in film history; each person will have her/his own favourites. We watch as Peter Reigert's character is slowly  seduced by the magic of the place, while those who actually live in it are revealed as utterly pragmatic, utterly modern - and utterly Scottish. We see some of the unguessed-at realities of the Cold War, get a look inside the insanity of Therapy as practised in the US, and as the film ends are choked up as Scotland emerges beautiful and magical despite being revealed as she really is.

The only thing that prevented a 100% score is the superfluous presence of the glaekit youth and the female scientist/mermaid. What was that all about? If it was intended to be part of the magic, it didn't work for me. Despite that, this is a peerless piece of writing and direction (both by Bill Forsyth). Don't miss it.",Local Hero

3,"If I didn't know any better, I'd be convinced that Hal Ashby directed this film. Bill Forsyth (the director of 'Local Hero') and Hal Ashby seem to have made films on the same frequency. Even if the film has the comedy label, it almost seems to be the opposite of what the general public might expect. The comedy comes from the drama that characters bring to certain settings. In a sense, that makes it much more humanistic.

The story in this film seems a bit too kind at times, but one could argue that's just the strategy of Mac (Peter Rigert), who is sent from Texas by Mr. Happer (Burt Lancaster) to scout the Scottish village in hopes to buy the land to build an oil refinery. Mac has such a quiet and calm way of talking with the village people, that the villagers think if they don't bring him an offer soon, he'll leave. 

While it's an easy going film, and most of it's Mac relaxing with the village people, it could have benefited from having slightly more of an edge. Happer, the president at the Oil company in Texas, has a side story with another big oil-man that seems like it will head into the terrain of angry drama, but it doesn't quite make it; often using dark-humor to calm your mind, just when something big could be cooking up.

""Local Hero"" may have been a film about greed, power and crazy oil-tycoons, but even oil developers have a little heart somewhere.",Local Hero

From its strong cast to the dry, hilarious delivery of the jokes, to the serene landscapes, this is a film I never wanted to end.

I don't have much more to say at the moment other than to give it my highest possible recommendation.",Local Hero

4,"Oil shill Peter Reigert heads to a minuscule town in Scotland to speak to the locals about selling their town to a large Texas conglomerate run by Burt Lancaster.  That's the story, but it's arbitrary, as the locals are more than willing to sell.  Rather than focus - or hell, even bother much - with that, Local Hero prefers to follow its heroes as they explore a place they've never been.  It's a gorgeous, charming travelogue with a narrative.  There are some embarrassing attempts at high-comedy gags (Lancaster's abusive therapist, for instance), but they are few and far between.  It's one of those rare films that perfectly captures the awesome, often beautiful, disorientation that accompanies travel.",Local Hero

3,"Newly noteworthy to British audiences in that it includes Peter Capaldi (Malcolm Tucker from TV's The Thick of It) as an exceedingly young man, although not looking that different. His character pursues the mermaidesque Jenny Seagrove without a single oath escaping his lips.

The film seems very dated now, not least due to the ubiquitous Mark Knopfler theme tune (used on many a sports broadcast in the UK at the time) but succeeds in neatly subverting expectations. The inhabitants of a gorgeous Scottish seaside town welcome the promise of Texan oil money through the worldly wise machinations of a young Denis Lawson - as handy with a set of accounts as he is with a frying pan - and there are touches of old fashioned humour including a cameo from a rabbit.",Local Hero

4,"Everything about this movie stems from the script and then the Forsyth's sublime vision of that script; yet it is not singular; rather a collective effort to realize the whole. What makes this movie over-and-above the usual run-of-the-mill ""big-man-in-a-little village"" setting (see The Quiet Man, et al for earlier takes) is that the the film is absolutely not about that. Rather the setting leads you to believe that, while in fact is setting you up for something a lot deeper. The modern V. tradition/big industry encroachment Vs. pastoral defense issues revealed have rarely been explored so thoroughly since; it is the commonality of the human soul that is the glue to everything that occurs. If you look too quickly you'll miss what's really happening. And if you still don't ""like"" it, then all I can say is: go find a shrink and consider auto-administered lobotomy as the best way out..",Local Hero

4,"This one surprised me. I don't feel like there's too much to say about it overall, but it's recommended. Peter Riegert and Peter Capaldi make entertaining leads, and Burt Lancaster dominates whenever he's on screen. Norman Chaucer gets a few hilarious scenes, and Denis Lawson, Fulton Mackay, and Jenny Seagrove all provide good support.

Some nice cinematography of the lovely scenery and an enjoyable early '80s soundtrack.

On the surface, you'd think you could predict every twist and turn in Local Hero, but the film manages to subvert a surprising number of cliches and avoid the expected twists. You don't get the ending you expect, but in this case, that's also a good thing - I'm giving the film an extra half-star for the fact that it doesn't take the predictable route with the ending. Recommended for a pleasant and humorous way to spend a couple of hours.",Local Hero

5,"Bill Forsyth, writer and director of Local Hero, exhibits true genius in this subtle and unassuming comedy about a Texas oil man who finds his humanity in a small Scottish fishing village.  

After taking a good look at the film√¢¬Ä¬ôs plot- an oil company tries to purchase a village in order build its refinery- it√¢¬Ä¬ôs apparent this is the kind of situation that has all the trappings of a clich√É¬©d √¢¬Ä¬úgood√¢¬Ä¬ù (simple towns-folk) vs. √¢¬Ä¬úevil√¢¬Ä¬ù (multimillion dollar American corporation) contest.  Yet Forsyth never allows the script to dissolve into such a simple dichotomy; instead he uses the circumstance as a vehicle for exploring the complex (and often contradictory) relationship between human beings and their sense of place.  

Unabashed yuppie Mac MacIntyre (Peter Riegert) is chosen by Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster), owner of Knox Oil and Gas in Huston, TX, to travel to Ferness, a small fishing village in Scotland, simply on the basis that his name sounds Scottish.  MacIntyre√¢¬Ä¬ôs job is to negotiate with the villagers the sale of their land; a task which he thinks could just as easily be accomplished via conference calls and telex machines.  While MacIntyre balks at the idea of leaving Huston for a town in the middle of nowhere, he does as he is told like any other good corporate man. Once in Ferness, MacIntyre finds that he is gradually adjusting to and enjoying the slower pace of village life- so much so that he begins rethinking his assignment.  However, the villagers have a different agenda (as Victor the Russian puts it, √¢¬Ä¬úyou can√¢¬Ä¬ôt eat scenery√¢¬Ä¬ù), and the negotiation takes an interesting turn.

Forsyth√¢¬Ä¬ôs gentle treatment of this potentially explosive event allows the audience to care for and sympathize with all parties involved.  His artful illumination of the paradoxical, yet very human, needs of each character makes it difficult to truly dislike one person over another.  

In an industry in which flat performances are the norm, Local Hero is a refreshing and original film.",Local Hero
5,"What a fantastic film.  Laugh out loud funny moments throughout in a similar irreverent  vein to Gregory's Girl.  The cast is fantastic especially Peter Riegert, Peter Capaldi and Burt Lancaster, who was actually in it a lot more than I'd led to believe.

I did enjoy the dialogue and characters at times but it never got past fairly interesting. Would have enjoyed if the characters could have been more developed. Local hero is worth watching if there isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt anything on but I would require a little more to happen for my liking.

2,"Local Hero felt like the longest two hours of my life, not once was I drawn into the story nor did I care about the characters in it. I'm not sure if this was a comedy or a drama or a mix of both if it was a mix of both then it failed. The humor is humorous but mainly because it's so dry. The acting is pretty good but none of the roles are really very demanding. This was one of the first times that I actually felt like sleeping during a movie, it is so boring, overdrawn and dry that it really made me want to go to sleep and forget about it, it certainly sets the mood for falling asleep like watching a painting show, it's nice to listen to with the music and everything but I really wanted to just fall asleep.",Local Hero
4,"What The Black Pirate lacks in terms of storytelling (the plot is silly and far from great) it more than compensates with the usually stupendous performance from Douglas Fairbanks. He is very charismatic in the main role. The movie is also meticulously crafted in its sets, costumes and action scenes, making for a rather adventurous flick.",The Black Pirate

Spectacular is the only word for it.",The Black Pirate
3,"Full review on my blog max4movies: The Black Pirate is a silent adventure movie about a man who infiltrates a pirate crew to bring justice to the men who killed his father. It features great set pieces and boasts generally high production values, however, apart from the frantic finale, there are only few action sequences. The performances and the stunt work are often great, which is why the movie is very entertaining. Apart from being one of the earliest color movies with a broad release, the movie is still very influential (e.g., the sliding down the sails scene). The plot is rather conventional, and the ending clich√©d, but considering its age and impact, The Black Pirate is still very entertaining and fun throughout.",The Black Pirate

3,"Doug Fairbanks leaps and bounds and slides down the rigging in this early two-strip Technicolor swashbuckler.  Sure, it has a bunch of pirate clich√©s (buried treasure, walking the plank) and lots of swordplay but it also seems to lag sometimes.  The early color processing leaves things a bit more red and green than we are used to - especially in the outdoor shots.  Doug swears to defeat the pirates after they capture his ship and kill his father, so he does what anyone would do - he joins up to defeat them from the inside.  In the process, he also has to rescue Billie Dove who is on the next ship they capture - of course, he marries her in the end (when they are both revealed to be royalty).  A bit of fun for Doug's fans but nowhere near as good as The Thief of Bagdad (1924).",The Black Pirate
2,ok silent swash buckler tale,The Black Pirate
3,"One of the earliest color films starring Douglas Fairbanks, it's a fun pirate-revenge film. Fairbanks plays a sailor whose ship is destroyed by pirates, so he infiltrates the pirate ship, pretending to be a pirate, and eventually becoming the revered ""Black Pirate"" of the seas. Of course there are incredible stunts throughout, expected from a Fairbanks flick, and this one does not disappoint.",The Black Pirate
3,"3.5: When I sat down to watch this 1926 swashbuckler for the first time the last thing I was expecting was for it to be in color.  The two tone Technicolor process, which had been used on only two previous films, is certainly nothing like 1950's Technicolor, but it still produces a wide range of colors that simply seems like a more muted version of real life.  Fairbanks carries the action and film with aplomb.  Some of the stunt sequences are really quite impressive, while the swordplay doesn't quite live up to Rathbone/Flynn standards.  The special effects are equally impressive for the day as the models used aren't that easy to pick out.  The production values are fairly incredible as well, as even on a new Blu-Ray release everything still looks authentic.  The locations are superb.  I can definitely imagine this story being absolutely fascinating for young boys (I only wish I'd seen it as a child as I suspect I would have enjoyed it despite it's dialogue intertitles).  The other main surprise, other than the color, was without a doubt the extremely violent and brutal acts either directly depicted or alluded to on screen.  These are not very pleasant pirates.  This rousing - but sometimes laughable effort by today's standards, especially when dealing with the romance at the end - picture truly must have something to behold back in its heyday.",The Black Pirate

4,"Watching this after seeing so many pirate films, well, it's easy to see where the influences are from. That said, Fairbanks puts them all to shame. Amazing in nearly every regard, you wont find a finer adventure popcorn movie. And not in a ""for a film from 1926"" way.",The Black Pirate

3,"This silent film remains a classic for numerous reasons. Fairbanks leaps across the screen with such grace, strength and charm. I can see how he inspired countless young boys all wanting to grow up to be just like him (for me the equivalent would be Indiana Jones.) Also, Pirates of the Caribbean could certainly learn something from the length of this film. It's only 80 minutes but it has everything you need for a blockbuster. It's astonishing how all the ingredients are here for the standard action formula. We're essentially still doing the same thing today. They also don't shy away from some gruesome bits which surprised me for 1926. Speaking of which, this was the very first colored film. Seeing a classic like this on the big screen with an orchestra (Alloy) certainly makes for a thoroughly entertaining matinee.",The Black Pirate

The first half was great, especially the awesome segment where Fairbanks takes over an entire ship by himself, I was hoping there would be more scenes like that throughout the whole movie. Instead it was just a pretty entertaining movie that threw in a useless romance story instead of putting in more adventurous moments. Fairbanks is indeed impressive with his agility and ""choreography"", I'm looking forward to checking out his other films.",The Black Pirate
4,"Alfred Parker√¢¬Ä¬ôs seafaring, swashbuckler √¢¬Ä¬úThe Black Pirate√¢¬Ä¬ù makes watching silent movies a genuine pleasure. Although Hollywood had produced a handful of pirate movies before this 1926 release, √¢¬Ä¬úThe Black Pirate√¢¬Ä¬ù benefits from scenarist Elton Thomas' gripping screenplay and Douglas Fairbanks' nimble physical presence. Indeed, √¢¬Ä¬úThe Black Pirate√¢¬Ä¬ù boasts some of Fairbanks√¢¬Ä¬ô best stunts, particularly when he slices into a sail with his knife and then lets gravity draw him down the length of the sail as the knife slashes through the canvas. He performs this stunt three times. The Kino DVD provides an insightful documentary about how Parker and Fairbanks staged this stunt. The exuberance with which Fairbanks leaps and lunges, the spectacular briny settings, and the wind-driven sailing ships make this above-average adventure opus an entirely entertaining spectacle despite its conspicuous lack of sound.  Anybody who enjoys pirate movies, especially the √¢¬Ä¬úPirates of the Caribbean√¢¬Ä¬ù movies, won√¢¬Ä¬ôt get sea-sick watching this epic.  Mind you, this isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt a fantasy with quasi-human creatures like the Johnny Depp movie. 

After the opening credits, the film presents three title cards that provide exposition.  The first one states: ""A page from THE HISTORY and Lives of the most Bloodthirsty Pirates who ever infested THE SOUTHERN SEAS."" The pirates that our hero contends with here live up to the bloodthirsty part of this description. The second placard adds: ""Being an account of BUCCANEERS & THE SPANISH MAIN, the Jolly Roger, GOLDEN GALLEONS, bleached skulls, BURIED TREASURE, the Plank, dirks & cutlasses, SCUTTLED SHIPS, Marooning, DESPERATE DEEDS, DESPERATE MEN, and--even on this dark soil--ROMANCE.""  Finally, the third placard states: ""It was the custom of THESE PIRATES to SUBDUE their prey, LOOT the ship, BIND their captives and BLOW THEM UP.""  Reportedly, Fairbanks and original director Donald Crisp quarreled and Fairbanks replaced him with Parker.  Earlier, Crisp had directed the Fairbanks√¢¬Ä¬ô 1925 √¢¬Ä¬úZorro√¢¬Ä¬ù sequel √¢¬Ä¬úDon Q Son of Zorro.√¢¬Ä¬ù  Nevertheless, Crisp remained aboard as a salty old dog of pirate named MacTavish who helps out our hero on several occasions. 

The agile Douglas Fairbanks toplines this lightweight but lavish escapade as the noble son of the Duke of Arnoldo.  As ""The Black Pirate"" unfolds, the sea wolves are looting a ship. They have tied up virtually everybody left alive.  Afterward, they run a powder trail from the deck to the powder magazine in bowels of the ship.  These pirates are extremely ruthless. Parker shows the ship in a long shot as it explodes and sinks.  Michel (Douglas Fairbanks of ""The Thief of Bagdad"") and his father are the only survivors.  Neither Michel nor his father appeared in the earlier scenes.  Not only are the details about their survival ommitted, but also you would think the pirates would recognize him when he asked to join them.  Meantime, Fairbanks' character doesn't show up until 9 minutes into the action.  Michel√¢¬Ä¬ôs father hands him an elaborate ring that Michel later uses to prove his identity.  Michel vows to avenge the death of his dad at the hands of dastardly pirates. The Duke's son masquerades as a cutthroat himself and confronts them after they have stashed their treasure in an underwater cave on the island. Before these pirates can stash their treasure, they have to dig up a chest with a key inside it to the locked gate of their secret underwater hiding place.  Michel fights his way into their ranks to end their criminal ways.  Before he challenges the pirate captain (Anders Randolf) to a duel, Michel fashions a makeshift grave stone from a piece of flotsam and scratches his solemn vow on it to exact revenge on the brigands. The treacherous pirates keep our hero guessing as much as he keeps teaching them one new trick after another until he defeats them.  Along the way, he saves a damsel-in-distress, Princess Isobel (Billie Dove of √¢¬Ä¬úYellow Lily√¢¬Ä¬ù) and wins her hand in marriage.  Some of our hero√¢¬Ä¬ôs clever tricks involve capturing an entire merchant vessel alone by himself. Initially, the pirates are dubious about his chances for pulling off such a stunt, but he captures the ship. Eventually, our hero vanquishes the villains after facing certain death by having to walk the plank. Meanwhile, Jack Cunningham adapted the story while Fairbanks, writing under the pseudonym of Elton Thomas, wrote the screenplay.  The only drawback to the plot is that some of the coincidences are just too good to be true. Principally, the same island where the pirates stash their treasure is the same island our hero washes ashore. 

Clocking in at a trim 94-minutes, √¢¬Ä¬úThe Black Pirate√¢¬Ä¬ù contains more than enough action for its length, and the characters are interesting not only for who they are but also what they accomplish.  Any pirate movie that opens with the pirate captive looting the dead is a keeper.  He appropriates the rings from thee dead sailors. Not long after this scene, the pirate captain spots a captive swallowing a ring.  The pirate captain summons a mate and pantomimes to him about how he needs to remove the ring from the captive.  The mate leaves while the captain watches him. When the mate returns, he hands the chieftain the ring that he eviscerated from the student's gullet. Naturally, the pirate captain gets his comeuppance when the Fairbanks' hero challenges him to a duel and defeats him.  Fairbanks doesn't so much kill him as the pirate kills himself when he falls on a sword that Fairbanks had stuck in the ground. The two-tone Technicolor makes the blood soaked forearms of the pirate stand out.  No pirate movie, not even the Errol Flynn sound classics, ever topped this until the advent of R-rated movies. Indeed, ""The Black Pirate"" has everything that a great pirate movie needs.  Interestingly, this was Fairbank's last major money maker.",The Black Pirate

4,This must have been a spectacular sight back in the twenties. shot in two colour technicolour this must have cost a fortune but the audiences must have loved this. this is the early twentieth century equivalent of a big budget action blockbuster with a top action movie star of your choice. great sets and fantastic stunts this is seriuosly worth a watch even if silent movies aren't usually your thing. can't believe i've never seen this before!!! highly recommended,The Black Pirate
3,"Its a basic adventure movie with a huge budget, but the technical limitations means no real sword choreography. There's not a lot of actual sword fights but a bunch of ""swashbuckling"", but its all good fun I guess..",The Black Pirate
3,all the better when you have neil brand playing his score.,The Black Pirate
5,"As far as pirate classics go them this is cinema treat. It was released in 1926. Shot in black and white and above all a silent movie, its still 1.5 hours in length and all the action and mystery you would expect from a pirate film.",The Black Pirate
2,"I liked Douglas Fairbanks' stunts and the old pirate with one arm who props himself up with swords/daggers to stay awake.  I liked when Fairbanks picked up his sword with his foot and other odd things like that which were influences on The Princess Bride (best movie ever!)  It's not really fair to rate this film compared to action films today; nonetheless, I must.",The Black Pirate
1,"I have rarely seen a movie as devoid of narrative energy as this one.  Just about all the scenes have no sense of tension, excitement, build up or pay off.",The Black Pirate
5,"Matt Kelly just reviewed this film and I was about to write my own review, but I'd like to point something out to him, first. I don't mean to sound like a pig, but Matt, if you would have watched the special features on either the Kino or Image editions of this film (no difference between them, except for the distributor; David Shepard produced both copies), you would realise that the camera work in the 1920's was more dynamic than it is today. All you have to do is look at Murnau's The Last Laugh, made two years before the Black Pirate, to see that this film's restricitions in movement were due to the technicolor equipment. All of the fades and transitions had to be done within the camera itself and it was probably much easier and less costly to the films producer (Fairbanks, credited under his pseudonym Elton thomas) to hurry this film to the market. Fairbanks took great pride in his box office reputation and that is why he took this gamble to make the film in Technicolor. 

Now, on to my review. I just bought a used copy of the Image Entertainment release, as pictured above. Like I said earlier, there is no difference in this copy versus the Kino copy. I bought this out of sheer loyalty to a dear friend of mine who produced this copy for DVD and Video. The Kino reissue boasts that the previous DVD release has been remastered by Bret Wood. I typically like Wood's restorations, but I know David personally, and I felt in some small way, that going for his original release copy would be a heart-felt benefit. This is my favorite Fairbanks film out of everything else he has done (yes, I place this even above ""The Mark of Zorro""). The innovations used in this film are so remakrable you would almost expect to hear the actors speak. This, as far as I know, was the first big commercial success (feature length) of the Technicolor company. They had made a previous feature film with anna May Wong called ""The Toll of the Sea,"" but it was independantly produced by Technicolor. The big studios had not yet totally embraced the idea of two-strip color. Fairbanks was at United Artists (long before they merged with MGM) at the time and I don't know why he made the gamble to make a big action picture with the experimental color process. However, it went over well and it has become a classic.

When watching the film, it may be helpful to remember that the only other commercial (meaning the big studios) uses of two-strip color were brief sequences which were used for publicity purposes. The prime example is Lon Chaney in ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925). Originally, it boasted practically half the film in color, varying from different processes such as the German color process, Handscheigl, as well as the two-strip Technicolor. All that remains of the original color scenes in ""Phantom"" today (to my knowledge) is the famous Bal Masque sequence. The Appolo's Lyre scene had reconstructed color in the Photoplay Productions restoration, so it gives an idea of what the completed sequence would have looked like at it's original release. Of course, the Photoplay resotration is only of the 1929 re-release, which was severly edited by more than an hour of footage from it's 1925 theatrical release.

As far as The Black Pirate is concerned, we are all very fortunate that a color print survived the years and that Film Preservation Assosciates has made it widely available, for the first time. All other releases of the film are taken from various other prints which exist in black and white. My guess is that these other prints originated from the Killiam preservation prints, which had only one or two scenes remaining in color, with all others tinted and toned. Special thanks to David for introducing me to this film as well as to my very first silent film (at age 3 or 4).

It's funny. when I finally got to meet him face-to-face, he asked what got me interested in silent movies and even though my father introduced me to the silents, my first silent film was a video produced by David. So, in a sense, he has been my mentor all of my life. I cannot thank him enough.",The Black Pirate
3,"Some top notch swashbuckling in this movie. Had they  been able to make the camera work, in the 1920s, more dynamic I would put this up against any action movie today.",The Black Pirate
4,"A nice, lush production with a great sword fight and grade A swashbuckling. A great example of well-placed action beats and plotting, with some nice melodrama and stunts thrown in. A potion perfected in Errol Flynn films, of course, but even Flynn's speed doesn't match Fairbanks' physicality.

3,"I saw this on the BIG screen with a live pianist playing along.  Pretty cool.  Not a classic,  But fun !!",The Black Pirate
4,"This 1926 Douglas Fairbanks adventure vehicle was filmed with an early technicolor process. It is available on DVD with the restored color. Seeing the costumes and pirate ship sets in even this incomplete form of color is worth it. It is a thrill to see the way this gang of pirates is portrayed in the mid-20's. Some of the stunts would be repeated many times in later pirate adventures, but this is no Disney portrayal. Fairbanks vows revenge against the band of pirates, who captured and blew up the ship on which he was traveling. They ultimately caused the death of his father. Fairbanks is a nobleman, who takes on the alias of The Black Pirate to gradually win the trust of and outsmart the scalawags. He defeats the previous Captain (Randolf) in a duel. He wins the admiration of MacTavish (Donald Crisp) and a peg-leg pirate (Wallace) as well as most of the crew by showing them some new ""tricks of the trade."" He never quite wins over the suspicious Lieutenant (Sam De Grasse) or the anarchic powder man (Stevens). The Black Pirate helps to capture a merchant ship. A beautiful woman (Billie Dove) is found aboard and he tells the men she is a princess. He secretly does everything in his power to protect her, the merchant ship, and its other passengers from the lawlessness of the pirates. Tensions build as the hours pass on the sundial for The Black Pirate's plan. Will the Pirate Lieutenant let the new arrival take power so easily? No. He must save the damsel at all costs and they fall in love. Lots of athletic sword play and climbing all over the ships in Fairbanks' bag of tricks. A nice behind the scenes set of clips is included on the DVD that show how some of the stunts were achieved.",The Black Pirate

A friend and I rented this movie as a joke. Imagine my surprise when halfway into the movie we both decided it was one of the best movies we had seen in a long time. Pantomine, in this movie, is a perfected art form, with Douglas Fairbanks exuding the heroism of his character with even the simplest of motions. 
 
The plot is well developed, especially considering that the sentenance frames were few and far between. Action as dialogue succeeded in effectively progressing the narrative. And unlike recent films, spectacular moves and effects were not used (obviously) or needed to aid and enhance the action scenes. Instead, battles and brawls were expressive and almost ballet-inspired. 
 
This movie contains everything that embodies the classic pirate tale: good ol' swashbuckling fun, walking the plank, kidnapping and romancing beautiful wenches, riding swords down the sails, and I believe, the origin of the phrase ""Dead men tell no tales!""
 
Filmed in double-strip Technicolor, I appreciated the rich, overly saturated colors. The color's flamboyance was a perfect complement to the miming and spoke to cinematic history. To know that as a technology Technicolor was as impressive to movie goers back then as the [i]Jurassic Park [/i]dinosaurs added to the sense of nostalgia I felt as I watched the movie.
 
This film is truly beautiful and entertaining and I would highly recommend it for anyone.",The Black Pirate
2,"Don't get me wrong, I am a great fan of silent cinema and there are some truly awesome silent clasics out there like Nosferatu, Safety Last, The General, City Lights, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari etc.  But this film just left me cold and nearly put me to sleep.  I can't imagine that people found this entertaining in its day, and they certainly won't now!",The Black Pirate
3,"I knew little of this film before watching it, but am glad I found it. It's an excellent early film about a group of cutthroats. The thing that surprised me the most was that it was in color. It was filmed using the experimental two-color technicolor process. After watching the ""Making of"", apparently Douglas Fairbanks was a real pioneer in that area and did much research on color film. This was my first Fairbanks film and I was quite impressed with not only his screen presence, but his ability to do impressive stuntwork, including the infamous sliding down a sail on a knife. This film had all the requirements of a pirate movie... Swordplay, torture, murder, robbery, kidnapping, romance, and even walking the plank. As well as the infamous quote, ""Dead men tell no tales!"". It had a decent score by Mortimer Wilson that was mostly fitting. One scene I found amusing, was when the pirates drew lots for the monkey. If you're a fan of pirate movies, this is a must see. I found it quite enjoyable.",The Black Pirate
4,"If you like pirates. This is one of the first and best Pirate movies out there. It has, easily, my favorite take over of a ship, ever. (And I love Pirates of the Caribean.) This movie, however needs patience and understanding. It was made in 1926.)",The Black Pirate

4,Technicolor...? Well - almost...,The Black Pirate
5,"This was the final film in The Douglas Fairbanks Collection, which I got for my birthday. One of the earlier Technicolor films. Some sources name it as the first feature length Technicolor film, others simply as the first Technicolor epic, which could mean something different. The fencing in this movie has come a long way from The Mark Of Zorro. Fairbanks and the bald guy look like they know what they're doing with the swords this time, and they look like they're really trying to hurt each other.
     Some of the violence is shocking even for today. Early on the pirate captain sees a captive swallow a ring, and points him out to one of his henchman. The pirate walks offscreen briefly and returns covered in blood up to his wrists, with a knife in one hand and the recovered ring in the other. Some time later, the second in command is sitting, and seems to be examining a sword, much as someone today might examine a gun before purchase. He makes a couple of swipes with it, then looks at a pair of captives tied to a pole next to him. He casually stabs one of them, like a child crushing a bug just to hear the crunch, then withdraws the bloody sword and goes back to examining it, all without a second thought. Finally, Doug himself has another strangling scene, almost as grusome as the one at the end of Robin Hood. Having had the satisfaction of pummeling his chief antagonist at the height of the climax, he places the man's throat across his thigh, then leans against the back of his neck with his full weight until he's dead. Very convincing and very satisfying.
     The story is minimal. Doug is the only survivor of an attack by the pirates, and joins them to destroy them from within as revenge for the death of his father. Things get complicated when a princess is taken captive, and Doug falls in love with her. A sort of bonus subplot comes from the intrigue raised by the question of the Black Pirate's true identity. The first hint that he's not what he seems comes when a captive from another ship seems to recognize the ring given to Doug by his father, then again shortly after when Doug tosses the man a note to be given to the governor.
     The colors look great, the music is perfect, and the running time isn't as overwhelming for Fairbanks fans who have trouble finding two or more hours for a movie in a typical day.",The Black Pirate

This made me so sad what has happened here. While nothing can be done to change the past, one can only look to the future and hope nothing like this will happen again. This documentary can only be described as a step in the right direction that is very difficult to watch yet I couldn't help but feel that it was important to do so.",Athlete A
3,"This documentary was sad, tragic, and heart wrenching yet empowering and satisfying since Justice was largely served at the end of the day. It really makes you think about who you trust your own kids with and what many innocent young individuals go through on a regular basis and not know if or why to report something that happens to them or someone else. I'm really glad that I watched this documentary that no only shed light on the disgusting sexual abuse, but the other kinds of abuse that took place in the gymnastics industry. Just wow...quite an unbelievable and historic scandal that I hope people get educated about.",Athlete A
4,"Chilling to hear the voices of the abused. Well made and informative. Hoping there is a follow up as to how not just US gymnastics, but all US sports organizations, have been affected by this case. How long were the abuses covered up if ever in other sports? While the film does answer some questions, there are many more to be answered!
Very good!!!!",Athlete A
4,"Athlete A is a rare type of true crime documentary, one which not only focuses on the experiences of the survivors, but does so with so much humanity that it creates an almost wholesome narrative about courageous women who got justice around a much bleaker story of heinous criminality and organizational corruption.",Athlete A
3,So Nassar got 120 years but the rest got what? At least the movie acknowledges that the worse physical and mental abuse are ongoing. 6/10,Athlete A
4,"Well Done Doc
Much has been reported on the topic of Nassar's sexual abuse against many, many elite gymnasts. This documentary breaks down the toxicity of the culture more so you can understand how something like this could have happened to so many athletes in the first place. Eye-opening to say the least.",Athlete A
4,Well done documentary that will infuriate you.  It is hard to judge this film because of the content.  It is so disheartening that you want to bring it to light just to get the message out there.  But I think it was a well done film.  And I think everyone should watch it.  But it is by no means uplifting.,Athlete A
4,A really good film about a terrible situation.  I think I like this better than other documentary about the same subject because of the investigative journalism angle.,Athlete A
3,"I did not like this documentary but not because it wasn't good; because of the subject matter.  The film chronicles the betrayal, abuse, and prosecution of Dr Larry Nasser, the Team USA gymnastics team doctor.  The film chronicles the abuse and the effort to overcome institutional bureaucratic cover ups to bring Nasser to justice. Powerful and important but deeply troubling.  The documentary filmmaking is good.",Athlete A
5,Outstanding documentary about a horrific conspiracy of silence.,Athlete A
0,This movie has been judged solely based on how it makes the viewer feel and not based on it's production or meaningfulness. It's not useful to watch.,Athlete A
4,"Pretty disturbing doco. These disgusting people are in so many levels of power that they make it so hard for the victims and families to speak up and be believed. All those mean online comments to the girls are from sick people, they group together to mock victims. Until it's too overwhelming to continue hiding what has happened, then they allow the sickos to be caught, no doubt some of those responsible for catching them are also sickos pretending to be outstanding citizens. Congratulations to everything the girls have achieved.",Athlete A
4,"It‚Äôs tough to know how to evaluate Athlete A. I tend to be someone who rates/ranks movies based on my enjoyment of a film, but there is nothing to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù here. Athlete A is the kind of film that made me sob in tears and want to put my fist through someone‚Äôs face. It gave me chills of horror and fits of anger (amplified by the fact that some of the vile events discussed in it took place mere minutes from where I live.) None of these are pleasant emotions, but the fact that I felt them so intensely is a sign that the filmmakers did their job. I have nothing but appreciation for the skill that went into presenting the story of the awful things that went on behind the scenes of US Olympic Gymnastics for decades. Athlete A is a movie that needed to be made, about a story that people need to know, but it is also a sensitive topic that will be hard (perhaps impossible) for some viewers to watch. I will say, while the details of what went on are discussed without holding back, there is some tact in the way it is presented. It‚Äôs a tough balance, but I think they did a great job. The film tackles the subject from 2 different angles. One side is presenting the way the story was broken by a newspaper, and how that led to countless victims coming forward to form the case against this predatory ‚Äúdoctor.‚Äù The other aspect of the film is a series of one-on-one interviews with some of the victims and their families as they discuss what happened. You have to applaud all these young women who came forward and were willing to relive devastating moments in their lives. They display such strength and maturity that it is truly inspiring. Of course, the more you admire these women, the more angry you get at those who victimized them, those who played a part in allowing it to happen, and those involved in covering up the truth. This is a blight on USA gymnastics, and makes me sick when I recall watching Olympic events and seeing those faces on the sidelines. There‚Äôs no doubt that Athlete A tells the truth in a powerful way, and I‚Äôm grateful that some filmmakers were skilled enough to do this story justice. They share the ugly truth in Athlete A so that others can learn from what happened to these girls, and hopefully we can avoid situations like this in the future.",Athlete A
5,"Compelling and emotional. It highlights the bravery of the survivors, the tenacity of the investigative repprters and the power that documentary filmmaking has to speak truth to power.",Athlete A
3,It was a good documentary which gave me chills to hear about the abuse towards young girls. What was the most horrible part of it was the cover-up campaign of the organisation.,Athlete A
5,One of the best 'sports' documentaries I've seen. Its a shocking subject but they don't reveal too much of the 'nasty' bits but also showed the aftermath and how the girls have recovered since. Now there just needs to be a full investigation into American Gymnastics!,Athlete A
3,"""Athlete A"" is a documentary that covers a disturbing subject that I didn't know anything about. I think on a technical level this is a fairly well-made documentary, even though I am not the best person to judge them because I usually don't watch many that often. I think more than anything else, the movie feels like one of the more essential documentaries out there because it covers an important and timely subject matter. It's one of those stories that showcase good journalism and sheds light on a topic that is important, even if it is pretty tough to watch at times.",Athlete A

5,This documentary is incredibly well done and truly eye opening. Definitely a must-see.,Athlete A
5,"Although the focus was on the first athlete to inform USA Gymnastics, the movie doesn't overlook anyone who played a vital role in the taking down of that doctor (I just can't say his name) from the original Georgia lawsuit which set off all the investigations into USA Gymnastics not investigating reports of abuse by coaches to Rachael Denhollander, the first to publicly come forward about that doctor.  It describes well how the investigations by the Indy Star unfolded and the key roles played by Andrea Mumford, the MSU police detective and Angela Povilaitis, the lead Michigan prosecutor on the cases.  It was well edited and flowed well. It doesn't go much into all of the missteps, shortcomings, cover-ups, and failure to act by Michigan State. It focuses more on the harm that doctor did in elite gymnastics.  Watching it made me both cry and feel anger. It went into just the right amount of detail of what that doctor did to children.  The HBO documentary, At the Heart of Gold, goes more into the MSU side of things and is probably even harder to watch because it goes more into detail of some of what that doctor did to non-gymnasts he saw.",Athlete A

This documentary shows the horrible handling of the horrible deeds by Steve Penny, Larry Nassar, and US Gymnastics. They need to prosecute the underlings who supported that organization. They need to take the big $$$ out of US Gymnastics and turn it back into a fun experience for kids.

The documentary is good, but mostly the last 20 minutes. It is good to see the Indiana newspaper who investigated and pushed for all this content to be opened up. Those journalists deserve awards.",Athlete A
5,"Powerful, infuriating and at times difficult to watch, but ultimately Athlete A is triumphant and necessary. I followed gymnastics as a kid but never knew its dark secret.

Well worth watching!",Athlete A
5,"Amazing doc! I thought I'd heard this story before, but I was wrong.

While I don't approve of the absolute dedication and practically giving up on their life of most ramen owners and I probably couldn't tell the difference between bad, decent and glorious ramen, I just have to appreciate the ""gang's"" input in all this.

5,"You might see a lot of mark-down reviews, how pointless this movie is, how it has some ahead-of-its time Pulp Fiction lack of continuity...I say, put it like this! It was way ahead of its time!
It was brilliant. It captures Japan. It doesn't conform to some gender-lost concept of emotional equity or lost angst that envelopes Hollywood like a wet-dog fur blanket. It DOES capture the amazing dicotomy and nearly alternate universe weirdness that was...and still is Japan.
If you can't afford a trip TO Japan, get your mitts on this movie and watch it like...three times. It seems simple, but bro, it is anything BUT simple! It is like a trip to a sushi-shop where the food come around on a track and you see what others are eating, it passes by sort of jerky and wiggling... but have to ask yourself...""Is that something humans should be eating!?"" 
Then you get bold and try it. 
Next thing you know you are naked in bed in the height of passion passing a raw egg from mouth to mouth until it bursts. Oh yeah. Once you go Asian, you never go back to Caucasian...Tompoppo. No movie like it.",Tampopo
4,"Tampopo is an interesting film that influences the vision of food. In fact, I love how this movie uses food as a symbol of everyday life from the ramen to the egg. I really enjoy the direction, the performances, the production design, the characters and the comedic tone. This is not just about rebuilding a ramen shop, but a highlight on food as part of our daily life. Overall, Tampopo is a love letter for food fans.",Tampopo
5,"""Tampopo"" is a bizarre but sophisticated cinematic satire that includes elements belonging to several film genres: road movie, spy movie, western, romantic comedy, documentary, martial arts movie, ""chanbara"" („ÉÅ„É£„É≥„Éê„É©, the so-called ""samurai movie"").
Various ingredients to give life to a sincere but parodic cross section of contemporary Japanese society, all seasoned with playful, simple, optimistic joie de vivre.
Different characters are united by similar cravings and desires: in each episode we observe the power and importance that food, constant in the film, has on people who cook, eat, taste, savor; often acquiring symbolic value and erotic connotations.
The narrative composition refers to the classic literary genre ""renga"" (ÈÄ£Ê≠å), in which the poetic lines are not connected directly to each other but linked obliquely giving a sense of uniqueness.
Itami's recipe is a success; ""Tampopo"" one of the most intelligent comedies of Japanese cinema history. The uninhibited execution, without restrictions (even breaking the fourth wall), creates a fresh and hilarious mosaic. The didactic nature of the main story is clear: only by setting aside one's disagreements and collaborating, facing life with vitality and positivity, one can hope to create an excellent dish.
""Tampopo"" is an irreverent and exuberant comedy with many references to the Japanese folklore heritage and influences and homages to the cinematography, creating new allegorical figures that enrich the popular imaginary.",Tampopo
4,"Unconventional, not for everyone, yet incredibly funny, well-acted, and well-shot. There are multiple 1+ minute long takes in this film that made my jaw drop. If you're looking for a uniquely clever comedy, watch Tampopo.",Tampopo
5,"The most delightful film that I now think about every single time I eat Ramen. This adorable, classic movie has so much to love",Tampopo
5,"Brilliantly funny, sexy and appetite-stimulating. A unique comic masterpiece.",Tampopo
5,"I'm going to get noodles tonight because of this movie.

Tampopo is a clinic in originality. On paper, there is no way this film should have ever worked; it combines classic spaghetti Western tropes with a foodie plot focused on ramen. It incorporate a series of brief vignettes focused on food that are totally independent of the main story and pop up sporadically without fanfare or context. There is a recurring subplot of a gangster who uses eggs in sexual ways. But it's all so brilliantly eccentric, so wholesome, and so hunger-inducing that you can't turn away. 

There is such a sense of playfulness and whimsy here that feels so lacking in other movies, a sense of experimentation that makes it engaging and fun. It combines distinctive elements of Japanese culture with a love of classic foreign films - the Western, the screwball comedy, and the gangster tropes - that Izumi manages to convey both a sense of comfortable familiarity and novelty at the same time. When it comes to humor, there is a very particular combination that Tampopo taps into, a mix of affability, cleverness, context-heavy dialogue that hits all the right notes; the closest that I can describe it would likely be the work of Wes Anderson or the Paddington series. You can't tell me that a series of bums passionately revealing their status as culinary masters directly into the camera doesn't seem like an Anderson-style scene.

Totally unique, hilarious, and wonderful. (5/5)",Tampopo
5,"There is a lot to say about this film, but let me just start off by saying that I absolutely loved this film! There is so much to admire and it makes you realise the importance of food in so many different ways than we can imagine.
The owner of a fast food point, who sells noodles takes help from two truck drivers to make her noodles better.
What confused me at first was the scene of intimacy between two side characters. For me, it first felt unnecessary and unrelated to the plot, and it only increased the age rating. Later, besides the main story, there were a few more scenes, not necessarily intimate, but unrelated to the story. That's where I realised what the film was trying to do. Other than telling the story, the film uses these small scenes to show how important food is for the Japanese culture in almost every aspect of life. Be it love or be it death. Food binds us in more ways than we think. This step is bold, but executed to perfection, because though at first it may feel unnecessary and overlong, it will surely get to you at some point.
The comedy in this film is gorgeous, and what makes it spectacular is how natural it is. It is not forced or unrealistic, and instead, makes use of the present situation to somehow make it pleasantly funny. It makes the film light and fun, not too tough and serious to bore you out.
Another thing that impresses me is the way the film hits almost every emotion. It is funny, sad at points, serious, joyous, and tense. The way it is constructed and the way it is acted really leaves a long-lasting impression.
And yeah, now I know how to eat my ramen when I get one, and boy did this film get me hungry for some!",Tampopo
5,"A film of gourmands, for gourmands, Tampopo had the most lasting impression on me than any film I watched in my college Japanese film class and is still exquisite in its comedy and commentary on mid-1980s Japan. Note* It took me forever to find this on a streaming platform, but HBO MAX has an excellent selection of domestic and foreign films, FYI. The film follows the main plot of Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto) and her trials and tribulations she endures to create a successful ramen shop ‚Äî not just successful financially, but in creating a truly great product. Her team, which grows throughout the film like a heist movie, consists of Gor≈ç (Tsutomo Yamazaki), the leader and reluctant sensei, Gun (Ken Watanabe(!)), Pisuken (Rikiya Yasuoka), Sh≈çhei (Kinzo Sakura), and ""The Ramen Master,"" (Yoshi Kat≈ç). Together, they train Tampopo in the art of broth and noodle making and conduct reconnaissance on competitors. However, the film doesn't just follow this plotline, but branches off into several other food-centric vignettes, most notable being the salaryman lunch where, after reviewing a classical French menu (in French), and none of the stoic men able to read it ‚Äî but too stubborn to ask ‚Äî all order the same exact meal (sole, consomm√©, and Heineken). However, the young associate/intern, literally physically assaulted for dropping briefcases and kicked underneath the table, places and elegant, inquiry-laden order with the waiter all to the chagrin of his elders. My two other favorite vignettes were the ""woman who keeps touching the produce and pastries"" and the ""spaghetti-eating lesson,"" which features a westerner who keeps interrupting the clinic with slurping of his own. A recurring subplot involves the ""Man in the White Suit"" (K≈çji Yakusho), a yakuza who would be called a ""foodie"" by today's parlance. The gangster and his mistress (Fukumi Kuroda) use food as sex-toy, beginning with something out of Varsity Blues to live-shrimp splashing on naked stomachs and mouth-swapping egg-yolks. His speech to his lover while bleeding out in the street, concerning yam sausages harvested from the belly of wild boar, is gold. It's a film about the boom of 1980s Japan, where even the homeless can describe Bordeaux wine like a sommelier and a woman rises seemingly from the dead to cook her family one final meal. With a feel-good ending, our cowboys riding off into the sunset, I love this movie and can't recommend it enough.",Tampopo
0,It's awful. Nothing to share,Tampopo

0,"The plot of this movie is that a woman really can make ramen, as long as a man helps her. Two randos also spit an egg into each other's mouths for ten minutes. Other than that, you're on your own for a seven hour snooze fest. Half a star for the cool homeless man that busts into a restaurant kitchen to make dinner.",Tampopo

3,"Tampopo is a 1985 Japanese comedy film written and directed by Juzo Itam. This movie certainly made me hungry. There are some comical elements, and lots of scenes involving food in many different ways, a few of which I could have done without. 1001",Tampopo
4,"Two truckers comes to a little ramen shop to get something to eat. They are not impressed but Tampopo, the cute lady owning the shop, got something the guys believes in. They befriends her and trains her, almost in Rocky style, so she can become the queen of ramen noodles. They visit competative shops, they run, they fight, they care for each other and they build up a new shop. The ride is both romantic and brutal. It's hard work but worth it in the end.

A very cute film dedicated to the love of food. Some nice side stories, like the food obsessed mob guy and the sexy girl he nails in rather hot ways involving foods of different kind. Cool charactes and a classic ""building up a shop and stay nicer than the others"" story. Fitting music and some uplifting and funny scenes.

It's gentle, but there are some blood, nudity and that kind of stuff just to stirr it up a bit. The recipe works like a charm and this is one of the better food films I have seen. A bit long, but never dragged. It's well paced in a way, actually quite fast even of the plot is quite narrow. I enjoyed this one - it definitely left me hungry.

8 out of 10 bowls of ramen.",Tampopo
5,Charming film. Saw it many years ago. Just ordered the DVD to see again...and again.,Tampopo
5,"Beautifully shot film about food. Entertaining from start to finish. This is a ""ramen"" western rather than a spaghetti western. Full of oddness and celebrations in regards to food and Japanese culture. The supermarket scene with the old lady is not a scene you will forget.",Tampopo
3,"It works more as a series of weird, funny sketches than a full coherent movie, and that is basically because it is a series of weird, funny sketches. ""Tampopo"" is a declaration of love to Japanese food and culture, almost a fetishist one, if I may add.",Tampopo
5,"I love how this is half a western and half satyre, while it's actually a comedy. Or is it?",Tampopo
3,"Written and directed by Juzo Itami the opening has truck drivers, Goro (Tsutomu Yamazaki)  and Gun (Ken Watanabe) having a craving for ramen noodles after reading a book out loud regarding a master ramen eater and his protege.  They would then stop at the first ramen noodle joint, only then it wasn't that good. The owner of the mini restaurant managed to convince Goro and his partner Gun to help her to make improvements.  Together, they would then visit as many ramen noodle restaurants to pick up tips just so Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto) hence the title can adjust to the improvements and turn her ramen noodle restaurant into a successful one.  Along with this movie is another subplot along with other strange characters.
   
 
 Tampopo although there is another sub plot",Tampopo
4,"Food lovers of all palates are certain to relish the numerous delectable images in ""Tampopo,"" an original, daring, and amusing love letter to our relationship with food, not only as a source of nourishment but how it makes us feel good-its visual presentation, scents, textures, flavors, the memories they evoke. Although a comedy, its strategy is never one-note as it consistently introduces one playful scenario after another. Yet, still, the picture does not come across as desultory, never relying on a parade of half-cocked ideas as painfully generic comedies so often do.",Tampopo
5,I really connected with the egg yoke scene.,Tampopo
5,"I like the little cheeky self-aware opener with the character in the movie that directly talks to the us, the viewer, basically telling us how annoying it is to make noise in the theater during the film. He also mentions how right before we die, we see a final kaleidoscope story of our life. I thought that was pretty poetic. 

I love how a truck driver is teaching Tampopo how to be a better ramen chef. I love the scene with the business execs. The whole purpose of this scene is to show they have no imagination, that they're all boring cut & paste people ordering the same shit the first person ordered. They wouldn't know good food if it hit them in the face, they care more about how expensive and high class it is. Fucking hilarious how the assistant boy outclassed them all with his knowledge of food. All the execs were literally red with embarrassment, fucking brilliant scene! I love how the guys, coming from different walks of life, all teamed together to help Tampopo fulfill her dream of becoming one of the best ramen chefs. It just goes to show that sometimes we can use a little help from strangers - who then become friends. 

This is without a doubt one of the best love letters to ramen and love for food. A supremely unique and creative cinematic experience that breaks film barriers while creating its own rules. The way it jumps around to other people's stories makes it so random and unexpected, yet so interesting and entertaining. Weird sexual food fetishes, learning how to make perfect noodles and how to eat spaghetti properly - this movie's got something for every type of food lover. It's got a distinct offbeat and charming sense of humor, all the while wearing a good heart. At times showing it's sweet and tender side to the audience. And it's fucking hilarious! Filled with a colorful and funny cast of characters. Very fun and random, sort of in the same vein as the movie ‚ÄòHouse'. I loved this movie!",Tampopo
5,A series of apparently unrelated and often surreal side dishes complement a charming and lighthearted main course.  This film is a zesty and satisfying examination of food and it's role in life and society.  Strange and unusual ingredients combine for a surprisingly rich experience.  Not to be missed!,Tampopo

4,"A rich and delectable ""food western"" from Juzo Itami that steadily supplies laughter and sumptuous imagery. Itami approaches his narrative with a sense for experimentation that might give Jean-Luc Godard whiplash, but the film's seemingly tangential trajectories never feel gratuitous. There are just so many great scenarios present here (Best. Food. Sex. Ever!), and it's hard to think of another movie that uses iris dissolves to such great comedic effect as Tampopo. It is a dish best described as such: it's very Asian cuisine, with enough western spicing to really give it its own unique flavor.",Tampopo

There were quite a few bits I found to be random which were probably cultural references but if you are amused by randomness then you'll find they flow in with the rest of the general wackiness. While I don't rate it quite on the level of Cantonese comedies such as the God of Cookery, Tampopo is still a fun view.",Tampopo

There is a moral/philosophical lesson after each scene, each and every one of them linked to that primal, uncontrollable need & love for food. I can only imagine how big of an impact this movie had at a time when film was just beginning to evolve.",Tampopo

5,My favorite movie about noodles.,Tampopo
5,"When I first back in the late 90s, my initial reaction was, ""Japanese feature film with a a Monte Python attention span"". No, it's themes and lack of slapstick antics aren't reminiscent of the 1970s British troupe, but it's one of the few films that exhibit a similar wild, completely unapologetic attention deficit, while retaining enough semblance of plot to not be mindlessly random. The juxtaposition of gourmet food with completely unexpected characters (truck drivers, hobos, Yakuza) is original, funny, and thoughtful. This is comedy at its finest and most creative. But don't see it on an empty stomach, you'll just be torturing yourself. It's a great movie to make an event out of: cook a great dinner, invite over a bunch of friends, and have a night of it.",Tampopo
5,One of my favorite films of all time.,Tampopo
5,"A film about the sensual subject of food, Tampopo is an absolute MUST see.",Tampopo
2,"Tampopo is a Japanese comedy about the art of noodles. It has plenty of funny scenes, especially the silent noodle scene. That brought some good laughs. But the movie loses all focus and has no concentration. This makes the film ultimately pointless. Also WTF was with the erotic scenes, this director would have a bright future in fetish porn.",Tampopo
5,"Still funny, and it still makes me hungry",Tampopo
4,"This won't be a review in the sense of what's good or bad about the film. It's a pure classic which can't really be rated, only described. The director succeeds in expressing a warm-hearted love of human life, but without sentimentality. The gently paced storyline meanders through several side-plots ranging from highly amusing to extremely violent. Tampopo is idiosyncratically Japanese but the humour and the emotional and philosophical content are universal enough to be thoroughly enjoyable for a Western viewer - in fact it's a lovely introduction to some of the eccentricities of Japan, especially around food. It's a film about food which really is, at least partly, about food. Does the quest for the perfect noodle stock have an existential meaning? Is the analogy a playful joke? I was far too relaxed to analyse it in that way, and the philosophy blends seamlessly with the characters and atmosphere. It's difficult to describe exactly what is so wonderful about this film. Watch it and you will be amused, moved, charmed - and hungry.",Tampopo

A widow Tampopo is willing to be proper noodle-cook with the help of a trucker (Ken Watanabe) who himself criticized her lack of proficiency at noodle-making.

Film covers several other sub-plots, an elderly woman who squeezes breads, loafs at grocery shop, a dying mother who wakes up to make last meal after being emotionally-taunted by her husband to make meal for the family and dies instantly, an old man who impersonates himself as a professor and scams people at the restaurant, a woman who teaches food-eating-etiquette, bunch of elite businessmen accompanied by young amateur who is more than often physically jolted by senior, he orders food (to sheer amazement of the seniors) in a way that it humiliates seniors who are without the perspective knowledge about foods-choice. But the central character is that of Tampopo and bunch of eccentrics determined to bring her business to fame and popularity. 

I have always loved watching movies surrounding subjects of 'foods'. Although my primary reservation about this movie should have got to be its duration, nonetheless I can take it as long as it's all about foods. Very dramatic, purposeful, and above all hilarious while dealing with few peculiar characters/scenes. This movie does take 'Noodles' seriously and it is perfect.",Tampopo

It will taunt your appetite and twist your salivating imagination around its chopsticks until your craving can't hold out any longer.  Hilarious and very Asian vignettes about the cultural importance of food in a Japan that's trying to westernize without losing its Nippon identity.

It's indescribable; don't try to describe it to your friends. Just say it's Monty Python meets The Good the Bad and the Ugly in Japanese.

The beauty of the movie is the attention to details about the noodles. Good food comes from a detailed process that is completly lacking in most of our lives. This simple desire to help one woman make the perfect bowl of noodles become an epic quest film. The food/sex scene in this movie beats out 9 & 1/2 Weeks by a good two months!

the primary story focuses on a widow trying to run a ramen shop and not having much success with it until a stranger comes into her shop one night. he helps her turn the shop into a success.

interwoven into this we get some odd short stories that don't always have any clear link to the primary story but are nonetheless interesting. in a hollywood movie they never would have made the final cut but i think they do add some complexity and poignancy to the film.",Tampopo

Tampopo on the other hand pulled off an intelligent, fun and even educational look at ramen culture. The main plot has a funny classic samurai movie motif which was quite funny at times given the skill and seriousness of the actors. The main problems from this movie come from the tacked on mini-stories which did not fit into the main plot... they were pretty distracting and not very easy to understand their relevance. This wouldn't be bad if the movie made me want to watch it again, but it doesn't, so fuck it. Definitely worth watching once and pretty good that one time. I'd watch it again if someone else was going to watch it.",Tampopo

<p>
Director Juzo Itami's culinary comedy <i>Tampopo</i> proved to be an important movie for the Japanese due to the way it introduced Western movie-goers to contemporary Japan and its agreeable sense of humour. Up until the 1987 American release of <i>Tampopo</i>, Westerners generally thought of Japanese cinema in terms of samurai pictures, even though Japanese filmmakers produced more comedies than films of any other genre. <i>Tampopo</i> altered this perception; demonstrating to Western audiences that the Japanese had an obsession with food and a delightful sense of humour. Despite a formulistic plot and some occasionally uneven pacing, this is an engaging cinematic hybrid which brilliantly mixes Japanese food and culture with a Western-style narrative. In fact, this quirky comedy is frequently described as a ""Noodle Western"".
<p>
At the centre of the film is middle-aged widow Tampopo (Miyamoto), who's struggling to make a living in order to support her son and cling onto her humble homestead. On a dark, stormy night, two strangers named Goro (Yamazaki) and Gun (Watanabe) visit Tampopo's home seeking food and shelter. They soon realise the widow lacks survival skills, and decide to stay to set things right; fighting off evil and restoring order before heading into the sunset. This may sound like the classic Western form, but that's not exactly true. The narrative is set in the industrial wasteland of contemporary Tokyo, and Tampopo's threatened property is a ramen (noodle soup) restaurant. Similarly, Gun and Goro are truck drivers rather than cowboys. Meanwhile, the task facing Goro and Gun is helping Tampopo to perfect her cooking and build the best ramen restaurant in town.
<p>
Writer-director Juzo Itami's movie is a genuine oddity. A Western-style story reminiscent of <i>Shane</i> lies at the core of the film, but said story is surrounded by a series of offbeat supplemental stories (side courses, so to speak), some of which last only a few minutes. A lot of these short vignettes may seem random, but they all revolve around the central theme of food, and they demonstrate how food can affect many different aspects of our lives. For instance, one side story concerns a gangster (Yakusho) and his girlfriend (Kuroda) who use food to enhance their sexual activity and passion in hilarious ways. In another short vignette, an old man almost chokes to death while eating, and a panic-stricken restaurant owner uses a vacuum cleaner to dislodge the obstruction from the man's throat. This particular vignette is apparently rooting in reality - a handful of senior citizens do in fact die each year while eating types of Japanese cuisine, and the vacuum-extraction method is not unheard of. Yet, while some of the film's vignettes are amusing, others are inexplicably and unnecessarily lengthy. The long-winded nature of the film causes pacing problems, leading to a number of dead spots.
<p>
Aside from the plot being structured like a Western, Itami crammed <i>Tampopo</i> with allusions and homages to Western movies of old. For instance, Goro wears a cowboy hat at all times, except for when he takes a bath. In another scene, Tampopo dreams that a gang of ramen chefs from another restaurant visit to challenge her skills, and they stride down the street like the gunmen out of <i>The Magnificent Seven</i>. Additionally, Tampopo's final noodle exam was filmed like a shootout; it's <i>Gunfight at the OK Ramen Restaurant</i>. Goro is a comical character as well, and he functions as a combination of Shane (the mythical hero who comes to town to set everything right before moving on) and the Man-With-No-Name role that Clint Eastwood played in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Comedy is additionally derived from simple parodying. When a gangster is dying from gunshot wounds in the pouring rain with his girlfriend wailing over him, he can only think about food - and his final words are about food.
<p>
In the cast, there are a number of recognisable faces. Gun is played by Ken Watanabe, whose more recent movies include <i>Batman Begins</i>, <i>The Last Samurai</i> and <i>Letters From Iwo Jima</i>. The kinky gangster, meanwhile, is played by K√¥ji Yakusho, who went on to star in <i>Band of Brothers</i>, <i>Babel</i> and <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i>. The entire cast delivered strong performances, and Itami reportedly selected these specific actors in order for Westerners to be able to distinguish between them (thus, he was fully aware that it was difficult for a lot of Westerners to tell Japanese people apart). Fortunately, the entire cast have an amiable nature to them as well, and it's easy to warm to each of the characters during their first few minutes of screen-time.
<p>
With the pointed satire, the at times inspired comedy, the appealingly oddball characters, the subtle flashes of pathos, the solid cast, and the orgasmic visual feast of food cinematography, <i>Tampopo</i> is a wonderful little gem of a Japanese movie. It's probably one of the greatest movies you've never heard of, as well. Granted, the picture contains a good 15-20 minutes of unnecessary flab, but, like a great bowl of ramen, it's highly satisfying. On that note, do not watch <i>Tampopo</i> on an empty stomach - you'll begin to crave food.",Tampopo

Bear the subtitles and enjoy it; I can't name a better movie of such a kind.

The shots were great and the actors were excellent as Ken Watanabe performed one of his proudest. GOSH. I bet those people who watched it in the theatre couldn't wait the movie is over and RUSH to a noodle shop and EAT. The point of this movie is about what's the best food and how to eat them.

I love how it throws random skits in between that have nothing to do with the main story, it makes you think for 2 seconds and refreshes you while you get back to the main stream.

You will be hungry for noodles.<p>When it comes down to it, this film is about a group of people that help turn a middle aged woman's cheap ramen shop into the best one in town.  However, there is much more in this movie than just that.  Why?  I do not know.  The beginning starts off with a man talking to the audience (you) about manners while watching a movie.  The opening credits is then in black and white and finally we are under way.</p><p>The story is interesting and there is sort of a childish tone to it, which keeps things fun.  Speaking of fun, throughout this film there are scenes that have just no meaning in here.  There are a few love scenes, an old woman in a grocery store, a man rushing home to his dying wife, etc.  The ONLY thing these scenes have in common is food.  The love scenes involve food as an aphrodisiac.  There is nudity and all.  The old woman in the grocery store is smashing food with her fingers.  The man rushes home to  his dying wife so she can cook her last meal.  Why are these scenes there?  To make the movie longer?  To make the story more entertaining?

it's about the Japanese and their food obsession!

I love this move because I love food. This is all about food. It appeals to me on so many levels and I highly recommend it to foodies. 

Aside from the main story line, the movie takes detours to adorable little side story vignettes. 

There are some scenes that are highly visceral and one that's sexual and may be inappropriate for younger viewers or watching with your grandma. 

I read a lot of other reviews and there's a lot of mention on the sex scene. There was only one sexy scene, really. I think it gets so much mention, because it seems out of place and startling. 

According to Wikipedia, this is one of Bjork's favorite movies.",Tampopo

4,"""Cool Hand Luke"" is a movie that works because of its emphasis on the main character and how brilliantly he is portrayed by Paul Newman. The movie stands as a unique experience in the prison movie genre because of the themes it presents and I enjoyed watching it. There are moments that are humorous and made for entertainment value, but the movie sticks with me because of the way the story plays out and how the ending made me feel. Overall, it is a piece of classic cinema that is memorable because of Newman's portrayal of a character who is simply cool and likable the whole way through.",Cool Hand Luke
4,"Intriguing performance by Paul Newman. He's so mysterious. Dark. Not foreboding, though.  He fills his character with depth, and it's about the most genuine acting I've ever seen.  The story seems tame for what it tells. Some of the images could be brought to life more, but I guess it was the times.",Cool Hand Luke
3,"A overrated, but good film staring the great Paul Newman being a cool prisoner in a prison chain gang.",Cool Hand Luke
5,"An All Time Classic and one of the most unique films I've seen. The closest I can compare this too is Five Easy Pieces (1970) but without the anticlimactic ending. Where Five Easy Pieces is about having talent and not knowing what to do with it, this is more along the lines of refusing to conform, being a born rebel, and trying to find a place in a world that can't accept you. This also looks more outward rather than F.E.P. which looks more inward. This is also better paced and never meanders. It's a slow burn that slowly reveals what its about. Every fundamental piece of this is pretty much flawless. This is definitely a challenging watch and encapsules the spirit of the late 60's and New Hollywood. Without a doubt though, Paul Newman is what sends this over the top. With very little dialogue he draws you in with his charisma, charm, and smile. George Kennedy also does incredible as well. Everyone should give this a watch. While I can't say every person will love this, it will definitely leave an impression on you and that says something.",Cool Hand Luke
3,Dated old genre. Well acted with plenty of stars.,Cool Hand Luke
2,"Yeah, it's iconic Paul Newman, George Kennedy gave a great supporting performance, and we'll always have that line from Struther Martin, but after seeing this a couple of times over the years,  I have to wonder about the point of it all.  A young man goes into a Southern work farm for two years for destruction of public property and decides to buck the whole system?  I just don't see it, but critics and audiences of the time did. Was it fair that our protagonist ends up with a bullet in the head? No.  Did he bring it on himself?  Unquestionably, yes.",Cool Hand Luke

4,"[2/18/21]: [NO RATING, so just putting what I believe it was]: Many defining moments that convey Luke's character, such as the egg eating, boxing scene, the escapes. The idolatry of the other men, and they turn on him when he exposes himself as human. The scene where he sings as he cries is a great performance. Really quite layered.

5,My favorite Paul Newman movie.,Cool Hand Luke
5,"Ok how do you sentence someone so harshly for being intoxicated and taking the heads off parking meters. I mean they gave poor old Luke 2 years in prison and you can definitely say with hard labor. I think the
 punishment for this crime should have been rehab and definitely some fees not prison. This guy ended up doing hard time and he shouldn't of been treated so poorly for what he went through. I really don't think he should've went to prison at all but if he didn't we wouldn't of had us such a great movie. No matter what they did to Luke he always had a smile.

He gives one of his best performances in this movie!!!!",Cool Hand Luke
4,"One of my all-time favorites.
""Sometimes nothing is a real cool hand.""
Paul Newman and the entire cast is superb. Newman's Luke is a man of indomitable spirit. You can kill him, but you can't break him. As long as a part of him is still his own, he can't be tamed.
I'll never forget when Luke led a crazy kind of revolt where he and the others on his chain gang treat a road at an insane pace because they want to...because Luke wanted to. That day they scared ""the man"" and made their spirits soar.
And then there was the time Luke decided that he could eat 50 eggs in an hour.

Cool Hand Luke was a hero, not an anti-hero. He never hurt a soul. (Although he did get drunk and cut the heads off some parking meters, and that got him put on the chain gang.)
The man hated Luke not for what he did, but because they couldn't break him. They couldn't make him conform.
This movie tells us that there is something in us that's all our own, and nobody can take it away but ourselves.",Cool Hand Luke
5,"Hampered by his direction? Get this man some milk. Being the antagonist in reviewing this film is in the spirit of Luke and his cool hands. If you don't like it, you consequently love it. This movie was made to highlight those who fight the power. So you obviously payed attention. 

Arguably one of the best socio-political commentary pieces of cinema. Spirited by oppression, power and humanity. You MUST see it if you want to make movies, or even watch movies in general. You'll also be disgusted by most modern day film even more.",Cool Hand Luke
4,"From Fast Eddie Felson in The Hustler to Hud to Butch in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul Newman's knack for creating vivid, true-to-life characters peaked with his role in Cool Hand Luke.  Receiving a sentence of two years for cutting the heads off parking meters while intoxicated, Luke serves his time working on a chain gang.  While a loner by nature, he gains the respect of his fellow inmates by refusing to live by anyone else's rules other than his own. Set in the America's Deep South, the film is almost devoid of color ‚Äì the viewer can almost feel the dust in the eyes and the sun burning the skin.  On top of the great performance by Newman, the film is filled with iconic lines (""What we have here is failure to communicate!!"") and scenes (fifty eggs in an hour).  The humanity of the prisoners is unlike anything you're likely to experience in any other prison films.",Cool Hand Luke
2,"Finally watched this, besides Paul Newman and George Kennedy being great, this movie was so boring. Guess 1967 didn't need much for people to be entertained, akward camera work, go to jail, be cool, escape jail, whatever.",Cool Hand Luke
4,"A very good movie that despite being released in 1967, still has more of a timelessness to it than movies released in the 2000s.",Cool Hand Luke
5,"Paul Newman at his best, not all great movies have to have a happy ending, but the best thing about this movie? How Cool Luke really is and how nothing can be a pretty cool hand.",Cool Hand Luke
3,"I'd give it about a 74%. Probably would have been better if I saw it closer to when it came out. He really just puts himself in jail for two years, becomes everyone's favorite at the old school jail and then escapes 3 times when doing prison work. Glad I saw it but not worth a rewatch",Cool Hand Luke
3,Another Paul Newman classic. Really enjoyed the movie but not as good as his other classics. It did have one classic scene which I keep referring to. The boxing match where Luke continues to get up and earns everyone‚Äôs respect. Classic.,Cool Hand Luke
5,"The harsh brutality of the chain gangs brought to life in this classic prison movie, superb performances by Newman as non-conformist Luke, a man who refuses to be broken and Kennedy, the hard man inmate who after initially trying to show Luke who's boss ends up worshipping him. The best prison movie ever made? Quite possibly.",Cool Hand Luke
5,It was a really good movie. It had some funny scenes and some sad scenes.,Cool Hand Luke

4,"An incredible portrayal by Newman -- despite what his biographer thinks -- put Newman on the list of ""100 Greatest Film Acting Performances of All-Time."" He was unable to win, but not undeserving of the 1968 Oscar for Best Actor. It might have been one of the toughest fields in Best Actor history and with a better job from the director's chair, it might have been the best film of the 1967 movie season.",Cool Hand Luke
4,"I never understood, when I first saw this as a child, what motivated Luke to take the heads off those parking meters and I remember being very confused and relentlessly questioning my parents about his motivations for this. I guess I couldn't make sense of all the suffering that followed because of such a silly and meaningless action. 8.5/10",Cool Hand Luke

3,"It's always interesting to see a film I have never seen before.

Paul Newman, as Luke,  is sent to work on a chain gang (in Florida!) after cutting the heads off parking meters while intoxicated. Once there, he has to deal with not only the hierarchy of the guards, but of the other prisoners. And Cool Hand Luke don't take kindly to being told what to do.

Newman cemented his position as a box office star with this role; his Luke enthralls us, charms us and engages our sympathies. Workman-like direction doesn't lift the film high enough to match his performance. The film remains very much of its time - one that shows our Cool Hand Luke fighting the establishment and achieving his ultimate reward.

A crowd pleaser for sure.",Cool Hand Luke

5,"I first saw this movie when I was thirteen years old and though I didn't understand a good chunk of this film, I felt that this movie was something special. After seeing it a few more times as I got older, I am absolutely riveted by it, I appreciate it so much more and I have come to adore this film. Paul Newman is amazing here, he IS Luke, he hides perfectly behind the character that he plays and he does such a damn good job at it. He is a drunkard who doesn't have much going for him and as you explore his past and his personality, you really get invested in his character, you get said with him, and you cheer for him when something goes right. He is so charming and suave, yet laid-back and chill about what happens to him, we see a great range of emotions throughout this film and every one of them is amazing. I loved his spirit and his boldness, he stands up for what he believes to be right, and we can't help but agree with everything that comes out of his mouth, even though he committed a crime and went there to be reformed, it really speaks for how well he pulled it off, he definitely deserved on Oscar for his performance, he was snubbed. George Kennedy, who did win an Oscar, was great too, he his the perfect other half to Luke, he was a jokester who liked to gamble, but he had been in prison for a while already so he brought the nice veteran presence with experience, and you really do believe that he knows all of the ins and outs and exactly how he should behave, I found him to be relevant to the plot, realistic, likable, and a well explored character. The portrayel of the prison life is amazing considering that this was made in 1967, they found great ways to make there character have interesting conversations and participate in engaging activities that contribute to the plot. I found the death of Luke at the end to be the perfect finish to his character, it felt earned and the best way possible to show how Luke grew and developed as a character throughout the film, it is very fitting, yet still very emotional and makes me cry. The new years eve egg-eating scene is so unique and memorable, it is fun and exciting to watch, and you can feel his pain as well, he is so strong and dedicated, it is actually inspiring. The main theme for this movie makes me tear up, it represents Luke perfectly and makes me remember that old Luke smile every time, it is wonderful and sounds great. The only minor issue I have with this film is the car washing scene was a little too gratuitous, it made sense in real life, but it really didn't need to be in the movie, but it's not bad. This movie reached emotional heights within me that have made me constantly go back and rewatch this masterpiece. I implore anyone and everyone to see this movie, I think that this is better than the Shawshank Redemption and I love that movie. With one of the best scripts ever written, the impeccable acting, the charming characters, the enjoyable plot, the entertaining jokes, great emotional sequences that feel earned, and one of the best original themes composed, this is a must-see classic.",Cool Hand Luke
5,"Another amazing performance by Paul Newman. Name a more handsome man, I dare you. No one plays a calm relaxed badass better than Paul Newman, deservingly getting an Academy Award nod. The supporting cast was also excellent, led by George Kennedy. The music and direction were also award worthy. The movie was terrific from start to finish, from the acting, to the storytelling, to the iconic lines. Anything less than a stellar review is a failure to communicate. A terrific and unique classic.",Cool Hand Luke
5,"Simply put, this is one of the greatest films ever made. This is a story about a man with an indomitable will and spirit, who, though he has everything bearing down upon him, simply refuses to yield.

5,"A grueling depiction of prison dehumanization.

Cool Hand Luke (1967) is Stuart Rosenberg's starling prison drama that goes to great lengths to demonstrate how the prison industrial complex breaks the spirit of its inmates. From the assignment of numbers to prisoners giving nicknames instead of their formal names. The brutal beatings, exhausting forced work, punishment chambers, verbal abuse, and general confinement all lead Cool Hand Luke into a vicious and harrowing experience of what it is like in a manual labor prison.

Rosenberg's direction is fascinating as he focuses in on character's anguished faces, sweat dripping bodies, languid movements, broken pride, and tired eyes. Rosenberg's direction is an accomplishment of dissecting the human condition and our natural desire for freedom. Cool Hand Luke mirrors our humanity and cruelty back at us in a starkly realistic picture.

Donn Pearce's novel and script heavily critiques authority and masculinity. Cool Hand Luke spits in the face of prison guards, wardens, and enforcers as bullies bent on projecting their insecure masculinity onto their victims. The prisoners themselves face the challenge of presenting their own masculinity to their fellow inmates in a display of dominance. They basically have to show how tough or strong they are in boxing, gambling, or talking before they earn the respect of the other inmates. Cool Hand Luke wins them over by thriving in all three categories, while finding ruin for himself due to his own quiet rebellion. He is punished for his overt masculinity and explicit disrespect to his captors. Cool Hand Luke forces men to look at how dangerous being the man with all the machismo is for your physical and mental health, while condemning the guards for their abuse of power. It's a clever dynamic at play in Cool Hand Luke. 

Lalo Schifrin's score is mesmerizing and delightful little melodies played in the style of country, bluegrass, and folk music with a contemporary twists. The music being so playful and uplifting contrasts the horrors of the jail experience in a profoundly upsetting way. The scene in which Paul Newman plays his banjo is very uniquely disturbing and sad.

Speaking of which, Paul Newman is outstanding and endearing as Cool Hand Luke. His sure and calm manner make for a nice foil for every other character in the film. Newman's gentle voice, hypnotizing eyes, and thoughtful grace display a more mature archetype for the masculine man. He is the opposite of George Kennedy's boisterous fool.

Furthermore, George Kennedy's Dragline character is hilarious and good humored, while keeping you transfixed by his strange performance. He character is loud, obnoxious, and fun. He is the prototypical male stereotype who butts heads with Luke for his own satisfaction. Once he gets to know Luke as a smart, cool, and resilient man, he respects him. It's a neat dynamic between these two characters.

The rest of the cast is interesting in how ordinary they feel. Harry Dean Stanton is kindly and meek, while Dennis Hopper is crazy and random. J.D. Cannon is confident and observant. The other prisoners are relatively regular guys and this makes Cool Hand Luke feel so lifelike.

Jo Van Fleet has a gripping cameo as Luke's dying and disappointed mother. She feels more grisly than the inmates. Joy Harmon gives an unforgettable car wash.

Of the guards, a few standout performances make Cool Hand Luke chilling. Strother Martin is commanding and fierce as Captain. Luke Askew is horrifying and revolting as Boss Paul Hunnicut.

Overall, Cool Hand Luke persists as a stellar social commentary piece on prisons and an excellent example of thoughtful filmmaking. Paul Newman's performance alone is worth watching for honestly.",Cool Hand Luke
4,"√¢Cool Hand Luke√¢? released in 1967 follows a man who is sentences to prison but chooses not to follow the rules. The film made me think a lot about those who are in the prison system. In the beginning of the film, it was indicated that Luke, who was only serving two years would be working alongside people who had done treacherous things and were serving 20 plus years. To me, the film separates itself from those in its genre as Luke proves to be a good guy overall. There isn√¢(TM)t anything that I wish they did differently. In terms of the writing, I loved the scene when Luke does the egg eating contest. It√¢(TM)s comical at how intrigued everyone is by it. It just goes to show how the guys in prison come to appreciate the little things in life as a result of their isolation. One of my favorite shots in the film is when the floor walker gives the prison rules to the men, the shot of him is with the camera down below him, looking up at him. This shot gives the character power and authority by having him tower over the other characters. A scene that I enjoyed regarding the editing was when Luke is sawing a hole in the floor of the bunk that they stay in. the shots cut between him sawing, people are around him dancing and having a great time, and then it cuts to the floor walker ringing the bell, almost catching him. Instead, Luke is able to hide the hole just in time. This series is a great example of adding tension. Paul Newman is tremendous as Luke, and he showcases such an incredible range in the film. He√¢(TM)s charming and endearing, he sings and plays an instrument, he has moments of joy and despair. It is easy to see why he√¢(TM)s had such a successful career and so many people love him as an actor. Regarding the cinematography, I felt that the shot when the prisoners wake up to start work was so beautiful. The sky is bright, almost white, and there√¢(TM)s an orange/pink glow coming from the lights in the cabins. It gives a beauty to a terrible circumstance for the men. A scene that I appreciated for the sound design was when Luke gets beaten up. The punching noises sound so painful and certainly warrant the reactions from the guys watching the fight.",Cool Hand Luke

5,Greatest film ever made. Period.,Cool Hand Luke
5,"Paul Newman was nominated for an Oscar and George Kennedy received one for his work in this allegorical prison drama. Luke Jackson (Paul Newman) is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. While the avowed ambition of the captain (Strother Martin) is for each prisoner to ""get their mind right,"" it soon becomes obvious that Luke is not about to kowtow to anybody. When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain. Along with stellar performances by Newman, Kennedy, and Martin, Cool Hand Luke features a superb supporting cast, including Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Joe Don Baker as members of the chain gang.",Cool Hand Luke

5,One of my fav movies of all time!,Cool Hand Luke
4,"Cool Hand Luke is a film that has never entered my film watching life. I've missed out on a real classic!
The star of the film is Paul Newman who until now I've only seen as the architect in The Towering Inferno.
He plays a petty criminal who ends up in a low security southern US prison. A prison that sends its inmates on hard working chain gangs and keeps the inmates locked up in a communal dormitory.
The petty criminal is sentenced to two years and soon earns the nickname Cool Hand Luke because he's called Luke, he is very cool and is good at cards! Luke also wins over the other prisoners for his bravery, bravado (winning large bets by eating 50 eggs in an hour!) and having the sheer audacity to say no to the system by making repeat escape attempts.
Each time he escapes he is eventually captured and on return to the prison he faces ever tougher sanctions be it iron fetters, confinement in some solitary box and being mentally broken by the guards by being given back breaking impossible tasks to complete. 
His final escape attempt is a tragedy.
A great film that despite its age shows that old fashioned life skills such as perseverance pays. You get knocked down, you get up again!",Cool Hand Luke
4,"A chill dude named Luke get's thrown in jail and sentenced for two years for parking meter robbery. He is a mysterious man, but he have most things his way, slowly becoming the most popular fella in jail - both among wardens and inmates. Well, he tries to run, he hates it there even if he plays it cool.

This is a character-driven film with a slow, steady pace that the movie escalate with in hormony. It's never boring or flat, it's filled with great performances and a neat turn on a typical, old prison film. Moments of fun and joy, often arranged by the man himself, makes the film better and a lot more playful. Some scenes are classics, like the carwash scene and the egg scene. The egg scene resulted in loads of egg eating among the film crew, so the next day on set was filled with farting and bad smell. That's hillarious.

Anyway, a solid classic with great acting by Paul Newman and George Kennedy - our main guys. Paul is perfect for the role as the gutsy Luke.

I've compared a few friends I've met during my lifetime to Luke because there's many people --- good people, who just don't fit into the common work-a-day world but who get along just fine with everyday people. Luke just wasn't made for the world. In the modern world, he would either likely find himself in prison as in the film or he would be homeless. Luke has charisma and everyone find themselves rooting for him eventually. His is the ""everyman"" character with heart that keeps him getting repeatedly after being knocked down. Paul Newman's performance is one of his best. Harry Dean Stanton turns in an outstanding performance with several moving guitar ditties at the right moments as segues. Of course George Kennedy is stellar as one might imagine since he earned the Best Supporting Actor award from the Academy. In closing I just want to say that this is the only DVD I've ever purchased because I don't like to ""own"" movies. I just couldn't pass this one up.",Cool Hand Luke

4,"Literally the only thing I knew about this movie was the one famous line, so it was interesting to see what the film was actually about.  Cool Hand Luke is the story of a man who is sent to a rural prison and decides that he will not let that life break him.  Paul Newman is great as Luke, his charm is so evident that you can see why he wins over all the people around him, and it makes the last act of the film that much more surprising.  All the prisoners are interesting characters, but many of them kind of fade into the crowd and I wasn't able to differentiate specific personality traits that set them apart.  But the one guy who stood out was the late-great George Kennedy.  He is the perfect actor for that role, and his fight with Luke is a great scene which causes a logical shift in his performance.  Perhaps the most engaging part of this film is the arc we see the prison guards go through.  Early on I saw them as very reasonable people, but as the film progresses you sympathize much more with the prisoners and start to see the oppression of their captors.  All around I think Cool Hand Luke is an excellent film, but it is tough to take the bleakness at times.  There's one particular scene that is heartbreaking which almost brought me to tears.    But to be honest, the biggest difficulty I had with the movie was the ending, so SPOILER ALERT:

In many ways this film felt like the anti-Shawshank Redemption.  Part of the joy of watching that film is that it puts Andy in a similarly depressing situation but he finds his happy ending.  In Cool Hand Luke the ending is so sad that I just can't imagine myself wanting to revisit the film.  It's well-made but I can't rate it as highly because there's another movie which is so similar that I like more, even though this one came out first.",Cool Hand Luke

Spoken by the Captain in this film, is one of the greatest lines, ""What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week. Which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it. And I don't like it any more than you men.""

There is much Christian imagery and allegory in the film.  Luke is linked to Luke of the Gospels, and is a Jesus-figure.  Luke constantly goes against authority and is supported by his fellow inmates, similar to Jesus.

This movie provides a template for The Shawshank Redemption.  As a matter of fact, this film predates Stephen King writing the novella and I'm positive he ""lifted"" most of it from this story.  It's pretty obvious.",Cool Hand Luke

I love Paul Newman but i didn't feel close to Luke, i couldn't sympathize. Two things only caught my attention: the number of dead animals- i mean a dog? come on- and the supporting roles of Dennis Hopper and Richard Davalos who didn't have one fucking line.",Cool Hand Luke
4,"Luke doesn't think of himself as a legend.  Sure, he's a decorated Korean War vet, and sure, he has good enough looks to inspire widespread questions of stardom.  But he ain't perfect.  So imperfect is Luke, in fact, that something as stupid as cutting heads off parking meters during a drunken stupor lands him in a chain gang, despite a solid reputation and round-the-clock likability.  When arrested, he doesn't put up a fuss.  To hell with societal expectations.  
	When he unceremoniously arrives on the grounds of the prison, he is instantaneously targeted by his personality searching counterparts.  He's a picturesque panther in a crowd of wild hogs.  They torment him, mocking his every word, attempting to find a demeaning nickname that suits his sardonic face - but he won't have it.  Luke is a man of integrity, of bravery; his ability to withstand dire conditions makes it easy for his peers to eventually idolize him.  All it takes is a losing fight where he just won't back down, and a willingness to devour fifty eggs for the sake of proving a point that doesn't really matter in the first place.  He does all this with a smiling face, somehow ignoring the brutality of the guards and the fact that he is, you know, spending the next two years in prison.
	If you were to only watch the first half or so of ""Cool Hand Luke"", you might look at the titular protagonist in the same way you did Harry Callahan and Frank Bullitt, an anti-hero worth bragging about to your friends because you knew him, because he was cooler than you ever were, because he was a crazy S.O.B. that didn't have much of a problem with questioning the MAN.   But the film is a multifaceted account of an idol, a layered portrait of someone who seems flawless in the context of one's soul searching thoughts, but, in truth, is just as much a mess as the fellow messes of the 1960s and beyond.  Perhaps the men of ""Cool Hand Luke"" will always see Luke as that guy who knew what justice was, the guy who didn't let the beating sun damage his seemingly uncrushable spirits - but the movie is just gutting enough to remind us that, beneath their slick dexterity, maybe John McClane was hot shit because he had to survive, not because he was trying to be hot shit.  Maybe Philip Marlowe looked danger straight in the eyes while also fearing for his life.  
	""Cool Hand Luke"" doesn't see its anti-hero through lazy rose-colored glasses; it doesn't want us to see him that way.  It is a prison movie too optimistic for its circumstances, one that just so happens to have a movie star leading the array of buffoons.  And once the film suddenly and quickly takes a turn down kitchen-sink-realism lane, we realize that ""Cool Hand Luke"" was never optimistic to begin with; it only seemed that way because its world was seen through the eyes of the prisoners that placed Luke on a pedestal for so long.  When Luke unexpectedly jumps off his pedestal and becomes a man who can't take the beatings of the guards any longer, our smiles are, without warning, slapped right off our faces.
	Paul Newman could have become the next Clark Gable/Cary Grant/John Wayne, a pretty boy with enough of a rugged exterior to pass himself as a movie hero, but the '60s changed any preconceived notions one might have had.  (Not that there were many, considering his star-making turns in 1950s fireballs ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"".)  He sprinted from one anti-hero role to the next, evidenced by ""The Hustler"", ""Hud"", and ""Harper"", all unseen by be (besides ""Harper"", which I enjoyed many moons ago and can hardly remember).  ""Cool Hand Luke"" is said to be his peak, his most famous moment of the '60s.  It's hard to disagree: Newman doesn't just provide us with one of the most investing cinematic characters of all time; he also gives a tremendously heartfelt performance, tricking us into thinking that he's an assured societal diamond accidentally in the roughest place in the state when, in actuality, he's a lost soul in search of existential meaning after finishing his prime years.  We become convinced that his drunken mind must have told him to steal the coins of parking meters because he simply had nothing better to do besides become someone else's God.
	Stuart Rosenberg's direction is arguably too cinematically voluptuous for its own good, making the life of a chain gang member seem sweeping and summery, like something out of a Loretta Lynn scented country song.  But maybe we only see the beauty, the characters finding themselves in an atmosphere emotionally similar to that of ""Papillon"".  But the screenplay, penned by Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson, is stunningly moving, upstaging Rosenberg's many intriguing directorial choices.  They find a commonplace between pity and empathy for the prisoners who spend their days doing nothing except idolize Luke.  They don't make them pathetic; we somehow understand that they probably never had a father to look up to and never had anything to discuss at home besides a female that glanced at them once or a cathartic bar fight they participated in a few days back.  
	Most notably is Dragline, portrayed by George Kennedy, who goes from active chain gang bully to Luke worshipper.  His fascination does not come from a homoerotic place; it, instead, is an unexpected twist in a life that has been cruel to him.  Finally, he has a friendship with someone that doesn't fear his toughness and doesn't write him off as a not so gentle giant.  Luke doesn't quite feel the same way, but we have an affection for Dragline.  He is so blinded by his new emotions of adoration that, even when Luke shows signs of human struggle, he can hardly ignore the charade that plays out over and over again in his mind.  Long after Luke leaves his life, he will still be telling new meat, and, later on, family members and bar patrons, the stories of Luke and what he meant to him, while they nod along politely, never quite understanding why the protagonist of his story was such a supposedly incredible guy.  Kennedy, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, is unquestionably terrific.
	But ""Cool Hand Luke"" is Paul Newman's movie, and is, on a broader scope, the movie that flipped the anti-hero clich√© onto its back and reminded us that, hey, anti-heroes have feelings too.  The film is as level-headed as it is romanticized.  We see life from the eyes of Dragline and Luke himself, as it just comes to show that a cinematic world isn't as much of an escape as we normally expect it to be.",Cool Hand Luke
3,"Cool Hand Luke has solid characters, some very memorable sequences, great first half and a terrific performance from Paul Newman and George Kennedy, but the second half is unfortunately too predictable, too inspirational and typical, the directing should have been better and the technical aspects all fall flat.

2,"Not really sure why this movie is so famous. Not to say that it was bad, but it didn't really entertain me that much. Maybe my expectations were too high from the reputation this film has or perhaps it's just a generational difference of what's considered entertaining?",Cool Hand Luke
4,"A defining role for Paul Newman. I love when he plays this type of character. He's a little more energetic in this movie, but I love when he plays the quiet, stone-faced man who stands in the background like a stage prop, but then when the going gets tough he uses logic over emotion and has a perfect plan. But he's not perfect. Things happen that bring his character down to earth. You think the character is being glorified, but then you find out he really doesn't have a grand plan, and he's just doing what he has to do when the time is right. You just can't help to respect him. People like Sylvester Stallone are parodies of Paul Newman.

When I first watched the movie the only scene that I didn't like was the freak out scene when he was digging the ditch. Because you didn't really know what he was up to up to that point and he stayed so cool, and the digging scene was so rushed I was disappointed that he wasn't faking the freak out. They really broke him. Then after him and Dragline made their escape and Dragline was saying he knew Luke had a plan, and you could tell Luke was a hero to him, and Dragline even makes the same complaint about the freak out scene that I just made, but then Luke just casually says he had no plan and he's not the criminal mastermind that Dragline thinks he is. That's the scene where the ego of the film is deflated and the Paul Newman persona was born. Much like Clint Eastwood, but still uniquely his. I still think the ditch digging scene was a little rushed, but it's totally forgiven.",Cool Hand Luke

One of the finest films ever made about the rebellious spirit of man, which is perfectly cast by both super cool Paul Newman and George Kennedy in the lead roles. Newman's low dialogue, yet not exactly silent role, is filled with subtle brilliance as you know exactly what the guy is thinking and feeling every single time he appears on screen, which is something beyond the control of both the writer and director, it's just 100% Paul. The movie is one of great memorable moments such as the mass egg eating scene, the road sanding scene, and the brilliant part in which Newman sings a few lines of plastic Jesus that shows exactly how he's feeling more than normal spoken words ever could. This is a superb film, and anyone who considers themselves even a small fan of cinema should watch this at least once in their lives.",Cool Hand Luke
4,"A terrific film with great performances with humorous moments a terrific film a true american classic 
Grade A",Cool Hand Luke
4,"Paul Newman stars in an anti-establishment drama, and, quite frankly, does it get anymore late 1960s than that? Sometimes you have to listen to the establishment, because even though ol' Luke is too cool for school, he's too pretty for prison, so stay in school, kids. Actually, Luke seems to think that he's too cool for the system, because even after they caught Butch Cassidy, he was still refusing to do what the man told him to. I guess that's to be expected from Paul Newman, but I think that he might just be here to vouch for screenwriters Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson in case people accuse them of ripping off ""Hombre"". Newman is just too cool for words, and I mean that literally, because between ""Hombre"" and this film, he probably just barely accumulated the amount of dialogue a lead role has in a regular film in 1967. Maybe it's a good thing that he's so quiet, because it lead to us getting the line, ""What we have here is a failure to communicate"" (I love Guns N' Roses' ""Civil War""), although, as much as the titular lead breaks the rules, that line was probably going to get here somewhere along the way. No matter what Newman does, it seems to always lead to a pretty good movie in this case, and yet, he isn't too cool to set this film above its problems.

The antics of the titular Luke Jackson and peers are fun and all, but in all of its working so hard to supplement your understanding of the characters and their dynamics within and amongst themselves, the film hits a few set pieces that are hard to believe, but arguably needed, seeing as how not much else is there to supplement the characterization. Developmental shortcomings prove to be a big issue in this film, for immediate background is lacking, and gradual exposition is surprisingly superficial, to where one ought to, in fact, find a failure to communicate, that is, the depths of the roles which are hard to get especially invested in. Still, no matter how much the film saves time by cutting back on exposition, it still clocks in at a little over two hours, and doesn't get their easily, on the back of filler, perhaps even some material excesses which lead to a sense of narrative aimlessness. If nothing else projects some sense of limpness, it's Stuart Rosenberg's directorial cold spells, which are limited in this generally either entertaining or engrossing drama, but still stand to sometimes all but bore and consistently bland in their defusing an even conceptually thin sense of momentum. Honestly, this film doesn't seem to be as edgy as it could have been, and that most holds the effectiveness back, through a lighthearted attitude that is punctuated by thin conflicts, further thinned out by all of the missteps in believability, development and pacing. What the film does right it does so very right, thus, the final product rewards, but not as easily as many say, for there's not much to say, and the storytelling says it rather limply at times. Still, on the whole, the final product rewards as some degree of the entertaining, when not biting drama it holds the potential of being.

I just got done criticizing Donn Pearce's story concept for taking potentially edgy subject matter as a generally realist study on prison life, and interpreting it into something a little light, but there's still something genuinely refreshing about this film, as well as promising, with dramatic intrigue, and a hint of colorful fluff. There is plenty of potential for entertainment value, and even Stuart Rosenberg does it a degree of justice, with a directorial performance whose steadiness is often bland, but rarely too much so, for their is enough subtle flare to Rosenberg's style to liven things up, and enough realization to the thoughtfulness to resonate about as much as he can with material so thin. Rosenberg feels confident in his storytelling more often than not, and that's endearing, especially when Rosenberg's efforts prove truly effective by their own right, in breathing life into an intriguing story concept and, for that matter, a solid script. Pearce and Frank Pierson get to be misguided in their both narrative overblown and developmental thin scripting, but their efforts remain memorably effective on the whole, with dialogue being razor-sharp, and set pieces being colorful in their keeping pacing up, at least more so than actual progression. Also commendable is Pearce's and Pierson's extensiveness, which is limited by natural shortcomings of the time and the story concept, and by the storytelling missteps, but realized enough for you to gain a firm grip on themes regarding the chemistry and questionable treatment of prisoners, and to find memorable roles through all of the characterization issues. This film needs for you to get invested in its characters in order to thrive, and that's where the performances come in, because just about everyone has a time to shine, whether it be Jo Van Fleet in a show-stealing cameo, or Morgan Woodward as a chilling antagonist, or George Kennedy in a delightfully charming, Oscar-winning performance, or leading man Paul Newman, who carries the film in his doing way more than the writers in capturing the iconically smooth charisma of the titular Luke Jackson character, punctuated by unexpected and powerful dramatic layers which humanize the leads as an effective audience avatar and protagonist by his own right. One can understand why the film is so iconic, for so many aspects to it are memorable in their being so effective, maybe not to where the flaws can be completely forgiven, but certainly to where the film compels, entertains and ultimately rewards.

Once the time is done, some lapses in believability, many lapses in expository depth, and frequent lapses in focus, under the weight of dragging, cold spells and, on top of all of that, natural shortcomings threaten the final product, but on the backs of intriguing subject matter, confident direction, sharp writing and powerful performances, ""Cool Hand Luke"" rises as an ultimately rewarding portrait on prison life in all of its color and grime.

3,"PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST

""What we've got here is failure to communicate.""

If there's one genre that generally impresses me, it's the prison escape film. I don't know why, something about the way the characters are handled in their situations leaves a lasting mark on me with each film. Which is why I loved films like I Am a Prisoner from a Chain Gang, The Great Escape, and O Brother, Where Art Thou. Cool Hand Luke is something I had wanted to watch for quite a while, due to the massive influence it's had over the years, even making reference in films like Toy Story 3 (""take him to the box""). And while I didn't enjoy Cool Hand Luke as much as I wanted to, I still found the film to be decently entertaining at best.

Luke  Jackson (Paul Newman) is sent to a chain gang in the Deep South after decapitating parking meters while intoxicated. Despite the captain's (Strother Martin) ambitions to ""get their mind right"", Luke gets his title ""cool hand"" due to his smarts in the system. But after a while, Luke's tired of conforming to his new life, so he plots to make a massive escape, becoming the symbol of hope and rebellion in the chain gang.

The problem with Cool Hand Luke is that director Stuart Rosenburg has serious pacing issues with the film. Some of the situations Luke faces in the camp is just extreme filler just to get Luke wanting to bust out, and it really bothers me. While the film becomes extremely enjoyable once Luke plots his escape, the hour and a half it takes leading up to it's a little bit of torture to watch. I didn't particularly enjoy Luke's ""cool hand"" poker game nor his conversation with his mother that had little to nothing to do with the actual plot.

Also the supporting characters are not interesting either. I wanted to like Luke's buddy inmate Dragline, played by George Kennedy, who won an Oscar for this role, but his character's so boring that I couldn't root for him to high, even if Kennedy did an alright job in his role. 

But there's three things that made me enjoy Cool Hand Luke for what it was. First, Strother Martin does a fantastic job playing the captain. Every single line of dialogue he says is so entertainingly brilliant that I wanted him to have more screen time than what he ended up getting. At least he says the best line of dialogue in the whole movie (that famous ""failure to communicate"" line).

Second, the score by Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible fame) is AWESOME!!! It's unique, it's delightfully catchy, and it leaves a lasting impact, which is what scores are supposed to do.

And finally, the real reason why I thought Cool Hand Luke was still a good movie was Paul Newman's performance as Luke. Considering that the plot seemed episodic at times in Luke's experience in the chain gang, Newman completely nails what Luke is going through. When Luke goes Man v. Food and eats fifty eggs, I knew Luke was going to be a very relatable character than many can root for. And that's what Newman does. While you want to know more about Luke's past, Newman graces the screen so well that you don't really care so much. Roger Ebert says it best. It's Newman's smile that makes his performance work so well. Can't explain it more. You'll have to watch it to know what I mean.

It's not the greatest movie in the world, as the pacing is a chore to get through at times, and the supporting characters aren't that interesting, but Cool Hand Luke still remains an entertaining prison escape flick, with Paul Newman's Oscar-nominated performance making up for my negatives on the film. At any rate, this manages to hold up better than the extremely overrated Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, also starring Newman.

And for me the third jewel in the triple crown of greatest cinematic art crated by Hollywood is Cool Hand Luke, which is and has been my all time favorite. A war hero who doesn't care about anything-even if we learned from his dying mother he once had great promise-and has no direction ends up in a chain gang over a petty crime. He captures the admiration of the inmates becoming their defacto leader, and even earning respect among the guards. Paul Newman's character might not give a damn about anything, but he won't give up or in to anything either. Toss in camera work that goes from intensely intimate to sweeping and epic as they tar a road and a stellar, deep supporting cast and this-for me-is as good as cinema will ever get. Strother Martin may have been type cast from this piece of art, but come on! His stammering, innocent sounding by remorselessly cruel camp warden he created was brilliant!

5,"Dear Rotten Tomatoes,
I scrolled through you're list of ""top 100 comedies"". While I seriously question your statistical methodology's validity, I am more troubled by the question of how your website classifies a film as a comedy. ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) is NOT a comedy. Sure, there are some tension relieving moments and even some witty banter in the dialogue, but the film is not a comedy. 
According to Merriam-Webster a Comedy is

1
a : a medieval narrative that ends happily 
b : a literary work written in a comic style or treating a comic theme
2
a : a drama of light and amusing character and typically with a happy ending
b : the genre of dramatic literature dealing with the comic or with the serious in a light or satirical manner - compare tragedy
3
: a ludicrous or farcical event or series of events 
4
a : the comic element 
b : humorous entertainment 

""Cool Hand Luke"" matches exactly zero of these definitions, unless ones sense of humor is strikingly similar to that of the Marquis de Sade. Do the people at Rotten Tomatoes ask, ""what was your favorite part, where his mother died or when they pushed him to physical exhaustion?"" Please note, I am not saying ""Cool Hand Luke"" is not a good film. It's exceptionally well made and everyone delvers a grade A performance. It's just not a comedy.

4,"A must see. A source of a million pop culture references. A great script, poignant acting and a gripping ending that will leave you....frustrated!

4,"Newman is awesome, but Kennedy steals the show.",Cool Hand Luke
3,"Film that more or less redefined the prison movie genre but also began the reinvigoration of the idea of rebel as metaphor. Here Newman is very good as the supposed 'rebel without a cause'. He's charming and likeable despite being a petty criminal, and he plays by his own rules as you'd expect, even when it's to his detriment; in fact *especially* when it's to his detriment. But he's not that one-dimensional, at the characters core of apparent cynicism is a lost sadness that Newman effectively conveys. George Kennedy is the real stand-out as the 'top dog' inmate who for once isn't a big bully but more of a paternal figure, who takes a shine to Luke when he sees he's a man who refuses to be broken. In this film, it's the characters that shine.

But then, we have the problem of such a weighty metaphor as the rebel and his role in society and I don't think the director knows what to do with it. This film contains many memorable set pieces, but also a lot of well... 'filler' that do it a grave injustice. The result is it just isn't as good as it could be, and some of the symbolism is a little heavy-handed. The ending was predictable, as well. In the end though, it's a good story and you'll be better-off for having got to know Cool Hand Luke.",Cool Hand Luke

5,"One problem with society is its tendency to marginalize those who are different or don't fit in and, to a degree, this is what COOL HAND LUKE is about. Luke is a loner who is picked up by the cops one evening for cutting the heads off parking meters while drunk. However inconsequential this crime might seem, it gets him two years on a chain gang and what transpires over the next couple of hours shows how one man resists a system which seemingly has no place (or use) for him. Despite the overall downbeat tone, the film still manages to have a sense of humor which is heavily derived from situations that one might find while in prison. It also helps that Paul Newman as Luke is so likeable and ""cool."" The title of the film comes from a scene in which Luke is playing poker with the other guys and wins by bluffing the other guy into folding. He says that ""Sometimes nothing is a cool hand,"" and from then on is called ""Cool Hand Luke."" Aside from Paul Newman's excellent performance, Strother Martin gives a great turn as the prison captain who, while seemingly easygoing on the surface, is quite authoritarian and does everything in his power to beat Luke into submission. He also gets an awesome quote which has become quite famous: ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate."" Not only is that a great line, but the way in which he delivers it suggests a weariness with the way that Luke has thus far managed to resist being broken. It was also nice to see Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Dennis Hopper in supporting roles. Lastly, the cinematography and score by Lalo Schifrin were also excellent. My favorite element was a repeated closeup of a guard's sunglasses which showed the reflection of what he was looking at, and in general, the on-location shooting gave a very palpable sense of what the characters were feeling whether it was the scorching sun or pouring rain. Overall, this is an outstanding entry in that latter days of Hollywood's golden age which has been extremely influential on the films that have come after it. Whether you feel like you fit in or not, COOL HAND LUKE tells a great story with fine performances from its cast.",Cool Hand Luke

5,"""What we've got here is failure to communicate.""This great prison movie was very enjoyable but a little not cool in the end, and heartbreaking. Paul Newman did his best performance in this career in this stunning prison movie. Cool Hand Luke is about, in this allegorical prison drama. Luke Jackson (Paul Newman) is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. While the avowed ambition of the captain (Strother Martin) is for each prisoner to get their mind right, it soon becomes obvious that Luke is not about to kowtow to anybody. When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain.",Cool Hand Luke

5,"In the hit late 1990's cartoon Recess, the teacher Ms. Finster devises a devilish punishment for the playground miscreants: the box.  The protagonist, T.J. Detweiler, is forced to spend a whole ten minutes of his recess in the box.  Referencing, of course, the first night in the prison camp, this episode of Recess shows the lasting impact that Cool Hand Luke had on the collective memory of society.  With an Oscar nomination for Paul Newman, and a win for Best Supporting Actor for George Kennedy, Cool Hand Luke is one of those movies that gets constantly referred to in other pop culture.  Still listed as 100% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes 46 years after its release, Cool Hand Luke is highly regarded as a classic film in every sense of the word.  
A decorated war hero with a history of insubordination, Lucas ""Luke"" Jackson (Paul Newman) gets 2 years of hard labor in a Florida prison camp for drunkenly cutting the tops off of parking meters.  He makes a quick enemy out of Dragline (George Kennedy), and after a boxing match in which Luke refuses to give up, they become fast friends, and Luke begins to emerge as a leader, motivating the inmates to finish paving a road in less than a day.  After eating fifty eggs (""No man can eat fifty eggs!""), Luke truly gains ""leadership"" of the group, but is sent to the box by the Captain (the warden), fearing Luke will escape after he learns his mother has died.  Luke makes several unsuccessful attempts to escape, and his final attempt leaves the audience with a twisted end and an oddly-satisfying sense of Luke as a tragic hero.
Cool Hand Luke is a great example of the prison escape genre of film, utilizing many archetypes of characterization, such as a rebellious inmate who may be serving an unjust term (or not, as the case may be), a warden as the main antagonist, and the process of gaining respect from his fellow inmates.  The camera spends a lot of time on Paul Newman, despite having a pretty loaded cast list, and being that Cool Hand Luke was shot at the height of his popularity as an actor, it's no surprise the film features gratuitous scenes of Newman sans shirt.  The eyecandy of Paul Newman is nothing, however, compared to the gorgeous composition of shots within the movie, often looking down at the prisoners, never up.  It paints them in the light of exactly what they are: criminals.  Additionally, the soundtrack is surprisingly versatile for 1967.  The scene when Luke eats fifty eggs comes to mind, when another prisoner taps on Luke's stomach, and is rewarded with a dull thudding sound, as if to say he couldn't possibly consume another egg.
The famous line, ""What we've got here is failure to communicate,"" will forever be immortalized due to the film, even sampled by Guns 'N' Roses for ""Civil War"" on their Lose Your Illusion II album in 1991.  Every film has its handful of haters, but as Captain states, ""Some men, you just can't reach.""",Cool Hand Luke
4,"What elevates this engaging drama to a remarkable ode to nonconformity is definitely Paul Newman's intense performance and its taut, compelling script, which both compensate for the story's exceedingly slow-moving pace and Rosenberg's inept direction.",Cool Hand Luke

3,"Il film non mi pare nulla di eccezionale e mi ricorda molto Papillon (anche in quel caso non mi aveva emozionato). Tutto si basa molto sulla figura di Paul Newman che verso la fine viene celebrato con una carrellata di primi piani di lui che sorride; forse proprio quella carrellata era di troppo, molto meglio i primi piani del sergente con gli occhiali da sole.",Cool Hand Luke
2,"The anti-establishment attitude of the Sixties is personified in the lead character of Stuart Rosenberg's ""Cool Hand Luke."" While Paul Newman is indeed ""cool"" in every sense of the word in the title role, the film unfortunately fails to recreate that same restless energy and urgency of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" (1955) - the spiritual predecessor of ""Cool Hand Luke"" from the decade prior.
Luke Jackson (Newman) is caught vandalizing parking meters early one morning. As punishment for his deed, he is sentenced to a prison farm chain gang for two years. Unsurprisingly, Luke refuses to conform to the norms imposed on him by both the guards and the other prisoners. His defiance turns him into a folk hero among his fellow inmates but the prison staff is less amused by Luke's antics since his rebelliousness leads to repeated escape attempts from the camp. Defiant to the end, Luke eventually forces a final confrontation between himself and the system he so despises.

""Cool Hand Luke"" is merely a serviceable vehicle for Newman. He turns in his usual stellar performance but the film is just one set piece after another interspersed with some occasional witty dialogue. The film does have some high-points - co-stars George Kennedy and Strother Martin are great and Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton and Wayne Rogers ably fill their smaller supporting roles. Also, the interplay between Luke and his mother (Jo Van Fleet) is genuinely touching and helps to add tremendous emotional depth to Luke's character. However, ""Cool Hand Luke"" does not take its exploration of conformity, individuality, and reform far enough. What could have been an in-depth and enlightening intellectual analysis of the society around us and our role within it ultimately winds up as just another routine tale of a spirited outsider.",Cool Hand Luke

5,"Just watched 'Cool Hand Luke', reputed to be one of the greatest films ever made. It starred the late legendary Paul Newman as the titular character, a man imprisoned for cutting the heads off parking meters. This is my verdict: it is a small, modest, subtle and amiable film to watch with the family with a combination of good acting, good cinematography, sublime music and a well-written script. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning one for Best Supporting Actor. Lalo Schifrin's score was also nominated, and rightfully so. The main theme is just so optimistic and casual, representing the bits of warm moments in the film. Overall, I find the movie rather light (unlike most classic greats which always turn out heavy and dragging half the time) and easy to follow. The humour is well-placed and the ending, though ambiguous and vague, leaves behind that 'Ol' Luke smile' on my face. The entire film doesn't boast of being or wanting to be great. It just is.

Anyone who wants to view the legacy of Paul Newman at his peak should take a couple of hours and watch ""Cool Hand Luke"".  Newman gave us so many wonderful movies and enduring performances and this film ranks with his absolute best.

Newman plays Luke Jackson.  In a drunken haze Luke vandalizes parking meters.  He is sentenced to hard labor on a southern chain gang.  He immediately butts heads with the Captain (Strother Martin) and the other inmates like Dragline (George Kennedy).

When he learns that his mother has passed away, Luke decides to break out, but his escapes only bring him greater contempt from the officers, but he becomes a symbol of defiance for the others convicts.

Director Stuart Rosenberg hits all the right notes, creating a truly memorable piece of filmmaking.  Paul Newman received an Oscar nomination and George Kennedy won the Supporting Actor trophy.  Too bad it failed to get a nomination in the Best Picture category.

2,"Cool Hand Luke is a movie about a shallow character that got exactly what he deserved. There was little to like about him and the rest of the cast was there to simply act as sycophants or to try to make Luke out to be a victim (which he wasn't, he deserved to be in prison). The movie lacks any meaningful exchanges between Luke and his fellow inmates--he's either trying to elevate himself or they're trying to live vicariously through him. Most of the exchanges have the other prisoners talking ""at"" Luke not ""with"" him because it's obvious Luke doesn't give a crap about them. The only time I felt anything in this movie was when he was talking to his mother--but the slight twinge in my heart was for her not him. The only other emotion I felt was disgust at the egg eating contest. 
If you want to see a far superior version of this movie watch ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (on most points it is the same movie). The only reason I'm giving this movie two stars is because of the technical aspects of the movie; as for the rest of it: there's nothing ""cool"" about Cool Hand Luke.",Cool Hand Luke

Even though he is never quite successful, Luke never stops trying to escape either.

5,"'Sometimes a handful of nothing is a real cool hand'. 

This movie gives me something new on each viewing. In the opening scene we see Luke (Paul Newman) as a drunkard cutting the heads of parking meters who finds it rather amusing when the police come and arrest him.

He ends up on a chain gang and shortly after that has a fight with another, much bigger and stronger inmate who repeatedly knocks him to the ground. He keeps getting back up, even though he's beaten bloody and exhausted - this is central to the character played by Paul Newman in this movie. 

 He becomes the hero of his fellow inmates and to them is an almost  Christ like figure of hope only to fall from this pedestal as it transpires he's only human after all as the prison guards force him into submission. However, in true 'Cool Hand' fashion, he doesn't stay submissive for long.

The film reflects the despair of a life without meaning, shows a man who, for rather silly actions, sinks to the bottom but glows so much while he's there he still seems like a winner and a hero to all those around him. Luke is a man who refuses to be beat all the  while he is being beaten, it's a classic case of ""the house always wins"" but Luke smiles all the while that he's losing so much so that you wonder if the house really did win. It's a piece of poetic existentialism.",Cool Hand Luke
5,"With a terrific performance by Paul Newman and full of christian symbolism, Cool Hand Luke is a movie about hope, perseverance and the search for redemption.

0,"If ""One Missed Call"" leaves the audience with anything‚Äîwhich it is unlikely to do‚Äîit's that the popularity of the J-horror-remake genre doesn't mean its movies will be good, or even coherent. This film strives for mediocrity but fails to achieve even this goal of predictable B-level couch fare.

Beth Raymond (an awful Shannyn Sossamon), after the gruesome, mysterious deaths of two of her friends, joins grieving detective Jack Andrews (Edward Burns) to uncover the evil spirit lurking in mysterious voicemails people receive of their own deaths. But any slivers of hope for this film are shredded as plotlines jump together with little rationality and horrible acting drags this movie into the abyss. Sossamon has a blank face for nearly the entire movie, and when she does try to act scared, she ends up a melodramatic mess. Not to mention the characters are as one-dimensional and have as little common sense as to be expected from a disastrous horror movie like this, with unrealistic emotional responses‚Äîor the lack thereof‚Äîand climbing into dark tunnels for the fun of it.

Behind the film-school-reject-quality acting and laughable plot, you'd still find nothing but amateurish effects (unfinished 3D bugs and body heat steam, for example), camerawork too distant to be personable but too nosy for any hope of technical proficiency, and cinematography more clich√© than the plot‚Äîif that's possible.

The acting wasn't that bad- it obviously wasn't even close to oscar-winning standards of course, but for the movie I think it was convincing enough. In terms of scare factor, it wasn't that scary. There aren't really any horrifying images either. Perhaps only in one scene that comes to mind. The part that was most disappointing are things in the storyline that just don't work for me:
1. The origin of this ""phone curse"". So we see that this originated when Ellie was locked in her room after getting caught physically harming her younger sister, Laurel. Ellie begins to suffer an asthma attack, who then desperately bangs on the door for help, then tries to dial her mother's number in her phone as she dies, thus beginning the phone curse, with Ellie's mother as the first victim. Not to look at it too logically, but when Ellie was first caught by her mother, hurting Laurel, I'm sure what (at least partly) brought on her asthma attack was the stress of getting caught and what this might mean for her. Obviously she has psychological issues, but perhaps she was scared her mother wouldn't love her anymore? Or she'd get sent away? Then her asthma attack begins, and she's panicking as she knows she needs medical help. She's banging on the door for her Mum to help, and tries to call her- again, for medical help, as she is in a medical emergency. So why on Earth would she even be thinking about starting some kind of ""killer phone curse"" when she's wheezing for breath and trying to get help? When you're on your last dying breath, you're panicking, and gasping for air, not planning out a whole (not to mention, supernatural) revenge. How a child would even think of that is beyond me- Ellie was pretty young. She had her issues, but she was just a kid after all, what gave her the ability to create such a curse?
2. After the cop is killed near the end of the film, we see an unfriendly spirit of Ellie approaching Beth (likely to kill her). We then see the saviour-looking spirit of Ellie's mother grab spirit-Ellie and pull her away from Beth, where we also see light (presented as the ""phone curse"") get sucked out of the dead cop's phone (which at this point would normally have already dialled the next victim) presumably putting an end to Ellie's cellular rampage. Yet once the spirit commotion is over, the late cop's phone dials the next victim's phone number. Why on Earth would you show a triumphant spirit, triumphantly end the curse, to only seconds later, just show the curse still active. Director just booked in a cheap ending.

Nevertheless, this movie still earns 3 stars as the premise was intriguing, and still fairly entertaining to watch despite the story problems. As far as horror movies go, there really is much worse than this.",One Missed Call

0,"Heinous pile of shite from the early 2000's. After The Ring made the ""contagious curse"" genre popular, a ton of movies tried to rip off its success. One Missed Call wasn't even smart enough to have a complex set of rules. And it wasn't brave enough to show us anything scary. They blew the entire budget pasting snapchat filters on harmless strangers walking by to spook our characters. The jumpscares were ridiculous and uneccesary. At one point a guy hands something to a character and they actually use a door slamming effect with loud music to try and squeeze another jumpscare in there. Because the movie has nothing else. They made a point to show us a scene where the main girl's professor was explaining childhood trauma because obvious foreshadowing. Then later she used her invaluable knowledge as a psych student to explain what Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy is to the detective because why would he know? Obviously they think the audience is ignorant and need this info explained. Boring, stupid, and cliche.",One Missed Call

The explanations for what was going on in the movie were so lame. Some stuff wasn't explained at all. There is also an extremely high amount of jump scares, all of which make you roll your eyes. One was so bad that the loud noise didn't match up with the ""scary image"". You'd think there'd at least be a little bit of tension to compensate for the lame jump scares, but there's a shortage on that too.

3,"Most people know this movie because of it's zero percent rating on this site, and it's not popular with audiences at all and never has been, so as soon as I found out this movie got absolutely butchered I set out to buy it, and to my surprise One Missed Call is a frequently spine tingling and dark mystery chiller, I personally don't define it as a horror. There's always a sense of dread and a few jumpy shocks along the way, and these shocks are emphasised by some truly creepy imagery. I loved the scene when the first phone call comes through, the look on Shannyn Sossamon's and Azura Skye's faces are very convincing full of terror, this is a well constructed scene. One by one the characters are picked off in gruesome ways in a final destination sort of manner but this movie's gore isn't that effective. Although the characters aren't ones you care for, the cast's performance are quite good, but there are some short moments where the acting is a bit off key, a little life needs to be injected but I like the cast and the storyline creeps me out. I think Shannyn Sossamon is a great lead, I'd like to see more of her movies.

2,"It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of ""accident"" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.
Now, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.",One Missed Call

When I started watching this movie I totally lost all hope for it.  It starts with a Japanese style house in the US, aside from Dave Spector making a cameo in the movie, I don't recall seeing any other Japanese related content, but the house seemed like the movie was trying to remind us, ""this story was originally from Japan"".

3,This remake of a Japanese film of the same name is about a ghost that is passed from person to person via their cell phones. After the person is killed the ghost grabs a person randomly from their cell phone contacts and calls their phone. The call is this weird ringtone and is dated for a future day & time. When they check the message they hear their own voice and what they will be saying at the time of their death. Edward Burns plays a cop who's sister was the first victim so he is working with a group of college friends to try and find out who or what is doing this and how is it happening. I like Burns so I enjoyed him in this. The ending left me cold so that is the only major issue I have with it. All in all it's a good watch and got some good spooky moments.,One Missed Call
1,"A ridiculous, incomprehensible tangle. I think it's actually a good premise, but the story doesn't support it and it makes less sense with every passing minute. Not even the solid Edward Burns can make a dent in this one. All that being said, it is still, strangely, watchable. OMC is a remake of a 2004 Japanese film and even that version was critically panned. And I think that is the root of my dislike (not the critics, but this particular storytelling subgenre). A lot of Japanese horror (and, IMO, a disturbing trend in U.S. horror) ends with the evil continuing. I want the 'good guys' to have more than a fighting chance to win, I want a survivor to ride of into the sunset having vanquished evil. Scares are why we come but nihilism doesn't add realism or intensity, just pointlessness and depression.",One Missed Call

Still a childhood fav :)",One Missed Call
1,"""One Missed Call"" is a complete mess of a horror film. It starts with a ridiculous premise: what if your mobile phone killed you? (an idea that has already become the subject of several parodies) and proceeds to run it into the ground. Basically, people receive a strange phone call where the sender leaves a message for them on their voice mail and it is dated from the future (for instance, if it was Thursday, they might get a call listed as Friday, 4:00 pm). Once you listen to the phone call, you realize that it's the sound of your upcoming death, which, despite your best efforts happens at the exact time of your voice mail. Your only hope to evade this fate is to go back to the beginning, using the hallucinations you receive as clues to figure out where the chain of deadly phone calls began.

The characters in the story react so casually to the events that are happening that you can't get invested in them or sucked into the story. You get some small glimpses of creepy distorted faces and there are a good amount of dead bodies in the end but if the victim's friends don't care, why should you? Like most movies based on Asian horror films, the story here is a mystery where the main character has to find the source of the curse in order to end the chain of events that threatens her. The idea with this type of tale is that as our main character Beth (Shannyn Sossamon) gets closer to the solution, the number of possible victims keeps getting smaller and smaller until she is trying to save herself or a few key characters by finally exposing some hidden truth or unleashing some kind of trapped spirit or something. Basically it gives us an explanation for why everything has been going on and she saves herself in the process. In this story the explanations for why phones are killing people are very loose and don't really make any sense. It actually gets downright silly when you see a dead body dialing a cell phone and the movie never makes its main characters act logically. There is one scene where we see a potential victim smash her phone and throw it away, which would be a logical thing to do, but everyone else feels like they're too attached to their phone contacts to actually try and intervene in the deadly chain of events. How stupid are these people?! We have established that the chain of deaths happens because the names of future victims are inside the phone of the previous ones... at least TRY and stop the murders by deleting numbers from your address book!

The film feels like a desperate attempt to make a concept that no matter how hard you tried, could never really be scary. There is a death at the very beginning of the film where someone dies, and they pet gets killed right after by the ghost and it makes absolutely no sense. Not only that the animal itself dies, but the way that it dies doesn't not match the explanation we get at the end of the movie at all. Well, unless it was one of those cats who likes to text people on their cellphones, I see those all the time in real life. The movie is PG-13 so even horror fans that can accept the thinnest of plots as long as they get their blood and nudity will be disappointed. With these limitations, you would think that this rating would direct the film into more suspense and unsettling imagery but there is only a tiny bit of those horror elements in the film. There are some great makeup effects towards the end of the story and this is where pretty much all of the excitement is concentrated. The more you think about the movie, the more it starts to fall apart and it becomes a ridiculous attempt at making a ghost horror movie. There's no reason to see ""One Missed Call"" instead of the many other superior Japanese horror ghost films that have emerged unless you really will get scared by anything and want an extremely tame horror film.

Pretty good idea but poorly written with predictable and boring acting and direction. One missed call is not worth a look at. I couldn't even finish it....",One Missed Call

1,"Right next to the haunting of Molly Hartley this is the worst horror film I've ever seen. There's not one good thing I can say about this utter disaster that never goes anywhere. The story's strange,consulted and never makes any sense until the end where they somewhat try to explain it but still does not help it at all. There's absolultley no character development so if someone dies you really can't give a crap. The acting is horrible and there's sadly no one decent enough performance in the entire film. And the movie never feels scary. Throughout it always try's to put this creepy vibe with the characters having strange visions but the cycle gets continuously done over and over throughout. If it wasn't scary the first time it won't get better. And it's also filled with lame,cheap jump scares throughout. One missed call is bland and just downright a horrible movie with no one good aspect to it.",One Missed Call

1,"A group of people begin to receive voice mails and messages from their future selves with some that include the dates, times and even some details on their deaths.  Sound bad to you?  One Missed Call is a terrible horror mystery flick.  It's an American remake of a 2003 Japanese film.  It's less horror and more horrible, lacking anything really scary, unless you count the script.  There are no real shocks or anything to make you jump either.  If you've seen some of my other reviews you'll know I'm not a big fan of PG-13 horror movies, there's only a handful I can stand.  The story is pretty lame and seems to rip off other horror films mostly the Final Destination series.  The cast is all ok for what they have to deal with including Shannyn Sossamon as our heroine Beth Raymond, Edward Burns as a detective, and Meagan Goode, Margaret Cho and Ariel Winter are some familiar names in the cast. I also found it amusing that this film has a 0 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.  If you come across One Missed Call somewhere, this is definitely one call you can miss!

2,"This movie just tries to hard at immitating the Ring but does not even come close to the chills that movie gave. This time instead of a video, it is a cell phone call you receive which comes from a dead person with your voice on it and date and time of death. In order to try to survive the call Beth (Shannyn Sossamon) who has already witnessed how three of her friends have died after receiving the phone call has to team up with the only police officer who beleives her story (Edward Burns, as to why he got involved with this film I still cant understand as he is a good actor). He believes her because her sister has recently died in a similar way but it seems no other cop is willing to help which is only natural in these movies. Together they will have to find a connection with these mysterious deaths and dont be suprised with the ending which also es very similar to the Ring. I didnt like this film which delivered very few scares if any. The visions which were supposed to be scary just seemed like normal people wearing bad halloween costumes. The only thing I will remember from this movie is the ringtone which I would like to have on my cell.

2,"""Left Behind"" is a film adaptation of the amazing Christian book series.  This imagining of the Rapture and the second-coming of Christ vividly brings the Biblical prophecies into a real-world perspective.  And it does it much better than the 2014 attempt.  The fact that they tell an actual story puts this far above the universally panned Nicholas Cage reboot.  In that version, they literally wrote the antagonist out of the story!  You could watch the two movies back to back and think that they were completely different stories.  And you would decide that this one is much better, so just skip the reboot.  The acting and special effects in a low-budget Christian film will never live up to that of a mainstream theatrical release, but this film is certainly better than a made-for-tv movie.  Kirk Cameron is the only actor of any notoriety amongst this bunch, but they all hold their own with actors from ""real"" movies.  The writers pour on the Christian testimony pretty strong at one point, but the entire story revolves around it so it didn't seem out of place.  A bit overdramatic, but not out of place.  In spite of its low-budget, independent feel, I have no issue recommending ""Left Behind"" if you are interested in getting a glimpse of how the Rapture may unfold some day.",Left Behind: The Movie
1,"Hideous bad.  Cameron, his days of being the adorable schmuck on ""Growing Pains"" now long gone, has found a niche in exploiting Christianity.  His movies are about as entertaining as watching squid mate, and this one is no exception.  The acting is so wooden I'm surprised the actors didn't call themselves ""Jane Doe"" and ""John Doe"" in the credits.  Sauced people trying to convince the cops they're not drunk have a better handle on the concept of acting than this former child actor and his cohorts.  It's proselytizing in the form of a sci-fi movie.  But I guess it keeps Kirk Cameron off the streets and from having to get a job at Burger King (I mean weren't the residuals from ""Growing Pains"" in syndication enough to keep him from having to resort to this?).",Left Behind: The Movie

0,worse than a kick in the nuts,Left Behind: The Movie
1,"Several months ago I reviewed the newer version of this film. Left Behind starring Nicholas Cage, was one of the worst films of last year. It was absolutely atrocious, boring, and nonsensical. Apparently, the film was based on an older film that came out in 2001. This is that film. As you know, this is Bad Movie Friday, and this is a bad movie. ""Left Behind: The Movie"" is directed by Vic Sarin. The cast includes Kirk Cameron, Brad Johnson and a bunch of other unrecognizable cast members.

The plot begins over seas where Buck Williams (Cameron)-a reporter- is interviewing a shepherd guy who owns a place he calls Eden. In the midst of there very interesting conversation, planes begin soaring overhead. Hundreds of planes fill the sky like birds. Thankfully, the swarm of planes don't crash into each other. Instead, they randomly start falling from the sky and crashing on the ground below in horrible CGI action sequences. Determined to find out what's going on-as if it wasn't obvious-Buck goes around places talking to people about random nonsensical things that don't matter.

I don't suppose anyone expects good performances. Frankly, they're aren't any. Kirk Cameron reminds me very much of Mark Wahlberg's character in The Happening. He's just so bland and boring. He delivers each line like he's high on drugs. To be fair, it's not the worst performance in the history of mankind, but it's very uninspiring. Every other actor has the acting ability of someone on the Hallmark Channel. In fact, I'm willing to bet they have better actors on their channel than are in this film.

On a level of production, this film fails miserably. The sets, visual effects, and score all scream horrible lazy 90's film. In fact it is basically a horrible lazy religious 90's styled film. That should tell you all one needs to know. The only redeeming value of this movie was the decent cinematography. Aside from that, the characters, script, and story are boring and lifeless. The dialogue is so serious and poorly written. The characters are never developed. The story is bland and uninteresting. Ultimately, it's just a horribly made Christian film with a awful doomsday message, attempting to scare people into submission of their doctrine.

""Left Behind: The Movie"" is a horrible, boring, and lifeless piece of doomsday garbage. The acting is serviceable compared to how awful everything else is. It's poorly written, heavy handed, and lazy. This film reminds me very much of The Happening. It's so idiotic, and it tries to make things so serious that it's kinda funny.",Left Behind: The Movie
0,"An interesting idea, but (and I say this as a devout Christian myself) piss poor execution. Sure it's low budget. No big deal. But low IQ is another matter entirely.

2,"Not terrible but it's low budget, and it knows it. It's based on a fictional series that is based on someone's interpretation and imagination based on the Book of Revelations from the Bible...which means it's not very meaningful or plausible.

Even if the production values are amateur (well, it was shot on a low budget), the movie keeps you engaged with a plausible scenario of how things could pan out. It actually has a few suspenseful moments and sets up the uneasy mood well.

1,"Left Behind is a movie based on a best-selling series of evangelical books about the Apocalypse and what happens after the Rapture takes the saved to heaven.  I am strangely fascinated by apocalyptic fiction/film so I knew I had to see this.  This was actually released in theaters despite having the worst production values of any theatrically released film I've ever seen.  The ""special effects"" are embarrassingly bad.  And Kirk Cameron, besides being a joke in himself, is meant to be believable as a hard-boiled CNN correspondent a la Christiane Amanpour, LOL.

I thought this might be some fun, like campy, but it was not, shocker.  It twists the Apocalypse into a warped sick evangelical version taught by a small sect of evangelicals that isn't accepted as Biblically correct.  It uses this distortion to teach a bizarre evangelical world view that is like the worst stereotypes of what people think evangelicals think ever - like women are inherently inferior to men and should be totally submissive, and that the UN will serve as a means for the Antichrist to seize power and take over the world (calling Jesse Helms), etc.  If you can manage to get into that mindset and try and think as they think, you might actually enjoy this, and feel yourself moved at things like the conversion of the wild child girl with lots of piercings and crazy hair (it's really funny to view how these conservatives think ""liberals"" look) into a Gap-wearing soccer mom sans piercings and with hair neatly pulled back into a plain barrette.

I first saw this movie and the store I bought it because of the Left Behind Book Series. I also remember Kirk Cameron from tv. Before I watched the movie I knew what it was about so it wasn't a big suprise. 
As the movie started Buck Williams (Cameron) is interviewing oversea when planes start exploding above their heads. They quick run underground to safety. Buck being the reporter his runs back outside and starts to do a live broadcast when and man shows up dressed from Bible days and begins to speak to him. 
On the way back to the US. Buck notices people disappearing from plane and they are no where to be found. The pilot takes Buck home with him. Ray (Brad Johnson) finds his home empty all that's left is his wife's clothes and bible and their sons clothes. They find out people are disappearing without a trace. Ray's daughter returns home. Buck, Ray and his daughter look for clues on what has happened.

There was no string of logic, except for the fact that we, the sheep, the general public, were continually reminded that an unstable, antiquated religious extreme exists in America and that this collection of Soothe-Sayers are ready to unleash religious propaganda in the form of seemingly high budget, yet easily recognizable B-Film format and content styled movies.  I am sure the producers will not answer our collective prayers and Leave Behind their silly interpretations of voodoo scriptures that include God destroying the Arabs, on behalf of Israel (a Nation of Fun Loving Criminals, to say the least). It would come as a blessing in disguise, if God would bring down his thumb and squash the people responsible for cheapening his name and spirit, which would include cast and corporation for distributing such mindless trash.

Kirk Cameron stars as one of the people who have been 'left behind' after the revelation. A lot of people start mysteriously disappearing and a bunch of people are trying to figure out why. The people who have been left behind have to find a way to find out what has happened and then try to change themselves in order to have a chance to make it after the 7 year tribulation without getting involved in the anti-christ's plan to take over the world. 
I thought ""Left Behind"" was a good movie. The only thing I didn't like about it was that I thought it ended all of a sudden without getting enough of the story in. Other than that, this movie has a lot of meaning to it and I recommend anybody to watch it, especially if you've been reading the series of books.

2,"When I heard that the series of novels were made into movies, I was very curious.  I had heard a televangelist (whose name shall remain anonymous) in one of his sermons state that his church was raising money to create a Hollywood movie with Christian values and morals.  I do not know if Left Behind is the result of his efforts.  Nevertheless, I was curious.

Since the film was produced under the idea that big name stars were in this production (Kirk Cameron?), I figured that this was a real attempt at getting the product in the mainstream.  I figured that it would have one of two points of view:  it either would be used as an attempt to get a religious story out to the mainstream in a form that the mainstream would readily accept, or it would be a work that preached to the choir (so to speak).

I must admit that I was dissappointed to find that it was the latter, although it tried...almost desparately...to be the former.  It is true that the film did flirt with the hypothetical line between preaching and true story telling.  Just when I would think that the film was a work presented to let the audience decide, something would happen that would lean way to the preachy.  Yet, when I was convinced that the film would lean heavily on the preachy and all would fall in line like Lemmings, something would crop up that would lean toward the story.

I really wish I could like this movie better.  As much as it attempted to get to that immaginary line I mentioned (the question of an affair or of family strife), it would do something that would yank me back such as using some catch phrases (the word ""truth,"" for instance, or Kirk's ""What the heck?"" question).

The movie was well directed and photographed.  It had the Hollywood look that it wished for.  I just have one suggestion that may have helped it draw a more mainstream audience:  take a chance.  When the producers approach that line, try stepping on it without crossing it.",Left Behind: The Movie

2,"I am just reading the books this movie and other sequels were based on...Some of my very Christian friends recommended them to me.  I consider myself Christian, but not evangelical so the message, at times, in the books got a little preachy.  However, in the movie version, the message started getting even more preachy.  The plot is rearranged to allow for more miracle conversions and some were a little too laughable.  It plays out a little like an after-school special, but the production quality isn't bad at all, actually.

In the movie version, Kirk Cameron is not a print media journalist, but a television journalist with the miraculous ability to be able to transmit anything without a camera crew, microphones, lighting, sound guys and satellites.  Is that a sign of the rapture?  Maybe not, but if nothing ends the world, the score certainly will.  Throughout the movie, I couldn't help but groan aloud over the score.  It was too overdramatic and the Christian power ballads were quite literally HELL to sit through and took an otherwise decent movie and made it cheesy.

In any case, don't call this one a ""movie"".  It isn't.  Standing alone, it would make absolutely no sense and a lot of people would be ticked by the ending.  It's a series.  Also, don't show anyone this as an incentive to read the books.  The first few Left Behind books are kind of bland and the writing, character names, etc.  After you get into the series, it's actually addictive in a drawn-out, hurry-it-up-already kind of way.

I swear I thought a young Rachael Ray was playing the character of Chloe (be prepared to vomit whenever you hear 'Buck and Chloe' in a sentence together).  Standout performances from Gordon Currie, who plays Nicolae Carpathia (what a douche-y name) and Chelsea Noble is perfectly cast as Hattie (another groan-worthy misnomer).

Why does it get 2.5 stars? It's not a great movie, by any means. The plot is fairly nonsense, the acting's nothing special (except if you count that the cast did this with a straight face), and there are no special effects to speak of. And no nudity. The bottom line of this movie is that it's a perfect representation of a ""B"" movie. The cheese factor is off the charts.

There is no point of Kerry Washington showing up looking like S&M barbie doll in this, and when stuff like this is stuck in otherwise great family films all the fudging time, you gotta question the choices of the filmmakers. Does adding the 13 to the PG mean Kerry has to look like an S&M barbie doll to make sure you get the allotted boner inducers in there? It's all so stupid and out of place.",A Thousand Words

It's a brisk 92 minutes so I figured I'd check it out (long before I discovered it had a 0% among critics!) The film is actually quite light and fun. Though it's not always super funny, I did smile through most of it. But there are also some legitimate good laughs to be had. Eddie Murphy is really funny when he speaks. Turns out he's also funny when he can't (or shouldn't). He finds some clever ways to communicate, even if they aren't all realistic. The film does have a few problems, such as him wasting words on the wrong people, and a few bits that's are way outside the realm of plausibility (such as an embarrassing restaurant lunch gone wrong). But in all, this is a film that I feel benefits by being seen out of its time. This is a fable with a mildly inspirational message to go with it.

Cast & Crew: (4/5) Eddie Murphy's character could be grating at first, but this yields a lot of room for his development as the film progresses.  Cliff Curtis was very good, as was Kerry Washington and Clark Duke.

True, A Thousand Words may not have an original theme and recycled jokes, but it is, in a way, traditional. Many people will not like this movie, and I couldn't give two shits.

Granted, the times Murphy did speak were funny at times. Unfortunately there were not many of those moments. Also, the way he mimed to people and the interpretations they took from it were beyond ridiculous and annoying most times. The character of Murphy's assistant played by Clark Duke was the most annoying and cringe-worthy character in the entire film.

Rating: 0/5
 ""A Thousand Words"" isn't really the kind of movie that makes you angry but there's nothing good about it whatsoever. The film is profoundly misguided with jokes that don't seem to be aiming for any particular audience, the plot itself is ludicrous and Eddie Murphy is probably at his most irritating ever. Maybe you can detect why this movie is so bad from the premise. Eddie Murphy plays fast-talking book agent Jack McCall who doesn't read books, he just sells them. He tricks a spiritual guru into letting McCall's firm represent his latest enlightening tome, which ends up being five pages. McCall is upset at the guru for pulling a fast one on him so the guru puts a curse on McCall in return. A tree grows in McCall's backyard and whenever he utters a word, a leaf falls off the tree. When the last leaf falls, McCall will die. But wait a second! How is McCall going to do his job and take care of his wife and newborn son without talking? Perhaps through... wacky antics?

In all fairness, the guru in the film doesn't actually place a curse on Jack McCall (that would have been more interesting). The tree sort of just appears out of nowhere because the universe hates the man. Why? Because he spends time at work providing for his family, isn't enthusiastic about moving out of the beautiful house with the pool he currently lives in and hates his no-good father who abandoned him and his mother when he was a child.

The real problem is that there is not one single person that acts like a genuine human being here. Let's say that you WERE afflicted with this kind of curse and that you couldn't talk anymore. What would you do? Would you go to your psychiatrist just to stay quiet? Would you go to work? Would you go to restaurants and try to order food? Of course you wouldn't, but Jack does. His life is literally on the line and he tries to go about his day like nothing's going on. If you didn't already dislike the character because he's a liar and a jerk, you won't like him because he's an idiot.

Everyone in this film is a badly written moron. Two prime examples are his assistant Aaron (Clark Duke) and his wife Caroline (Kerry Washington). The moment that Caroline notices that Jack isn't speaking to her, she immediately assumes that they are having all kinds of problems. He can't answer her questions and was too stupid to write down on a piece of paper exactly what is going on and keep it with him at all times so here come the contrived assumptions. She thinks his silence means at various points that a) he doesn't love her anymore b) they need to spice up their marriage c) he doesn't want to move out of the house d) he doesn't care about the safety of his son. It's one of those movies where apparently these two people have just met despite being married because there is no trust whatsoever. Next is Aaron. They desperately try and make this character funny and it never works. Clark Duke does his best ""black guy"" impersonation for Jack and predictably, he screws up all of the business deals. I suppose it makes sense that the dumbest guy in the office hired the stupidest intern to assist him, but it isn't funny, it's infuriating.

Murphy never speaks, so he jumps around miming what he wants to say just so everyone around him can misunderstand in the most ridiculous ways. Jack goes to the Starbucks, tries to order and leaves with CDs, muffins and at least a half dozen drinks. How do you misunderstand directions for coffee into a $68 order? When McCall points towards his head and mimics a gun motion (for three shots) I thought he was telling the clerk that a) he wanted to kill himself out of frustration, which I really sympathized with or b) he wanted the guy taking the order to drop dead, which I was hoping would happen.

Who is this movie was made for? You'd think with the nutty premise that it would be for children, but no. Murphy giving the finger, Aaron talks about strippers and sex in the office, Caroline dresses up like a dominatrix and there's quite a bit of cursing. Maybe it's for adults then? But what kind of adult would be tolerant of Eddie Murphy acting like a mime on acid for an hour and a half? Any adult would also be able to see through the obvious moments of forced sentiment made to have you forget how unlikeable the main character is and would not tolerate this brain-dead story.

 I'm convinced that the people who edited the movie and added the special effects knew that this was an absolute train wreck and they did everything in their power to subliminally manipulate the audience into not burning down every print of this film. From the very beginning, if you look closely you can see that in the title of the film ""A THOUSAND WORDS"" as it fades out, the letters ""USA"" takes slightly longer to disappear. Coincidence? Maybe. But I think it's yet another subliminal attempt to make you ""like"" this film. Further proof comes with the ending, which is overly melodramatic and forces in a ""nice message"" that has no place in this story. It's such a predictable, lazy conclusion that you won't believe they went there.

Like I said, the movie isn't quite as infuriating as say... wearing a suit made of poison ivy, but this movie flat-out sucks. It's cheap, it's manipulative, it's overacted, it's generic, it's not funny. Ever. I can't think of anything good about it, and can't fathom anyone having a good time with it, so it gets the lowest review possible, a 0/5. (On Dvd, June 2014)",A Thousand Words

I really feel something happening in a healing way with this film. I hope that the negative reviews that it received had not closed the door on this mode of expression in comedy. Comedy needs to release a great amount of anger and reach into forgiveness, it is in that forgiveness that Comedy is born, because it is a attainment of understanding and an alignment with compassion. This vehicle allowed the artist to move through this vividly and expressively in community space without any extra motives.

Honestly! I actually wanted to see this movie since I like Eddie Murphy! But this is just....wow. I can see why it's faded into obscurity, since this movie is awful! 
Having Eddie Murphy as an unlikable central character (which is a personal pet peeve of mine) is absolutely horrible to watch. I hate his character and I wanted to see him suffer. 
And watching him suffer was just...not funny. It was just a bunch of nothing happening since, well NOTHING WAS HAPPENING. He couldn't talk, and that's about it! They didn't work with the concept , which is why the comedy fails. 
The one redeemable factor in this movie was the climax, which was very touching since our main character had to pick and choose his final words. He had some nice things to say. Props to the script for that. 
Then the ending happened and...oh dear. This ending is awful. Just awful.
Don't watch this movie. Let this movie disappear so I will never have to talk about it again.

""A Thousand Words"" is an absolutely amazing movie; it's just everything about forgiveness, calm, politeness and peace. If you are totally focused on perusing the upper social mobility in turn neglecting all those sweet things that makes your life, then your striving is of no use, live for what you really want to, don't simply mess up your life with unnecessary complication, wow! its absolutely what I realized watching this movie, life is the best opportunity you get than any other chance you seem to consider as a great opportunity, so live it to its full, give up all those unnecessary hatreds, jealousy, anger, arrogance that mess up with your life and makes worse, be calm and analyze the reason behind your immediate outburst, when your mind is in peace it gets the chance to take a right decision, enjoy your living, make this world a better place to live in, make others to be happy in this one entire mysterious wonderful system called EARTH.

To mention about the making of this movie the person to be mentioned is Eddie Murphy, he is perfect with his fine combination of performances, he truly stole the show, Cliff Curtis had given proper justice to his role but the presentation makes the movie raw, screenplay could had been bit more better with some more essence of intense emotional, this movie seems to be missing something.",A Thousand Words

Well let me tell you, sure the film is not a masterpiece and double sure it's not Eddy Murphy's best vintage but this film has a very strong and beautiful message at it's core. The story is very symbolic and the ones who regularly flirt with spirituality will inevitably hear and see the signs. Inner peace, listening to the voice inside, planting roots in your garden, be truthful and above all, learn to forgive to move on. I can't imagine why the reviews were so negative, it's a nicely shot film, bathed in a beautiful golden light, the story holds itself quite well, the film has a few cliches for sure and some scenes would have gained in emotion with a less heavy handed touch. Nevertheless, with a few heartwarming scenes, some silliness, an Eddy Murphy 'over the top' as usual, the film managed to somehow work for me.

It certainly doesn't deserve a 0% score; the premise is interesting, Murphy manages to be entertaining without his voice, and it's a pretty decent comment on how everyone in our society talks all the time but never stops to listen. So, as weird as it is to say this, this is a good movie. Check it out.",A Thousand Words
2,"Comedy starring Eddie Murphy as Jack McCall, a hyperactive and somewhat unscrupulous literary agent with a life dilemma: a strange tree has suddenly appeared in his back garden and it loses a leave for every word he says. Fearing that once it loses all the leaves he will die, he tries to save all his words for important stuff, however he has got a difficult deal to break at work and his wife is unhappy for his apparent lack of commitment. The fact that he hardly says anything creates funny situations as it further worsens his problems. In his quest to save the tree he receives the help of his stressed assistant and an Indian religious guru.
While it is humorous and entertaining, this film is too similar to Jim Carey's ""Liar, liar"", the premise and development is almost the same. Plus some scenes are somewhat forced and the laughable plot has several contradictions. Basically the bulk of the film relies in the comedy skills of the lead actor; the rest is dull and easily forgettable. If you are fan of Murphy you are going to like it as he is at his best, it is just there isn't enough in the movie to make it memorable, plus it is terribly predictable.",A Thousand Words

5,"great movie. Eddie Murphy has still got it, as always, He is One of my all time favorite ACTORS",A Thousand Words
3,"Eddie Murphy has had a lot of interesting roles in his time.  Most of them were in one movie.  A Thousand Words is his newest comedy from Steve Koren (writer) and Tom Shadyack (director) of Bruce Almighty fame.  While not as hilarious as Bruce, It's still a very good movie.  The comedy in the film is somewhat lost in the tension of the situation, but the story is very interesting and pays off, finally after a painful but entertaining character journey.

Murphy plays Jack McCall, a fast talking agent who's used to getting everything on his terms.  He fits his wife and son in where it's convenient and conquers his world by signing anyone who can build his personal empire.  High on his own esteem, he sets off to sign a new age spiritual leader to sell his book, based solely on his large number of followers.  When he talks his way into a deal, a mysterious tree grows in his yard over night that turns out to be connected to him.

He soon discovers that every word he speaks causes a tree to fall and that once the tree dies he will too as everything that happens to the tree also happens to him.  Jack struggles to refrain from speech and focus his thoughts into simple terms, resulting in anger and occasional outbursts that bring him ever closer to his looming fate.  Meanwhile, his family and career fall apart and he is helpless to stop it.

Ultimately, Jack's efforts to save himself fail, but he eventually reaches an understanding of the guru's philosophy and why he is so troubled.  In confronting his past and releasing the anger he holds onto, a transformation occurs within and he experiences a sort of rebirth along with the tree which bursts into full bloom.

It's not a side-splitting comedy, but it never fails to be interesting and the heart of the movie is really quite touching.  Eddie Murphy effortlessly leads the film which is boosted by an exceptionally talented cast of minor characters.  It's definitely a feel good movie with a redemptive message, like Bruce Almighty, and the story is well honed and crafted even if it falls short on laughs. A",A Thousand Words

0,"I used to enjoy Eddie Murphy. I thought he was a fantastic comedian, and a lot of his films are hilarious. He's been out of the game for a while. Well, if this was his idea of a comeback film, he picked wrong. A Thousand Words follows the story of a smart mouthed man who uses his words to get himself what he wants, only to find out that he has one thousand words left to say before he dies. This is one of those high morality concept films like Bruce Almighty. The only difference is that Bruce Almighty isn't dreadful in every conceivable way. The acting here is rough, especially from Eddie Murphy, who has been reduced to silence and grunts. Everyone else is just plain bad. The short run time drags on for what seems like an eternity. The worst offender? There is a horribly unbalanced tone. Overall, this was as bad as the 0% on Rotten Tomatoes suggested and definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen.",A Thousand Words
2,"I saw the other reviews and this isn't is greatest work but I believe it really not his worst either. The irony kinda tried to carry the film but didn't quite make it to the end.

Over all: 60% not bad,not good. 2 and 1/2 stars.",A Thousand Words
2,"<i><b> If A Thousand Words' formula seems familiar, that's because writer Steve Koren has tripped down this quasi-metaphysical path before in ""Bruce Almighty"" and ""Click."" While A Thousand Words features some reverent flashes and even has the potential to touch audiences (a moment involving a mother with Alzheimer's particularly hits home), it suffers from being too broad. Before this star vehicle devolves into a soggy New Age sermon, Murphy's manic pantomiming offers a few faint flickers of the mad comic genius from 1987's ""Raw"". The formulaic script by Steve Koren doesn't manage to exploit the absurd premise with any discernible wit or invention, and the star is left floundering. The director, Brian Robbins, perhaps as a result of his prime-time pedigree, has so carefully engineered this manipulative machine that little emotional residue remains - only a product inoffensive, unsurprising and uninspiring. <i></b>

VERDICT: ""In The Zone"" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)",A Thousand Words

3,This movie is more about what's important in life than about evoking laughter.  It sends a positive message and also has a few areas that are funny as well as some scenes that are more suggestive in nature.  I hope that the next movie Eddie Murphy stars in portrays him more as a comedian as opposed to a loud obnoxious person that is trying to find himself.

In a world where everyone does nothing but constantly talk this movie takes a man that has made his living with words and voices and forces him to use only his skill to portray the roll.

Eddie Murphy does the best he can with his muted and meant to be misconstrued for eternity type of character. Although Murphy hasn't delivered in recent memory, those around him certainly don't do him any favors in A Thousand Words.

The film yearns for the audience to care about the characters and to reach some kind of epiphany with the high-brow lesson-learned.

2,"Its amazing how far and low Eddie Murphy has fallen, this guy used to be an action/comedy star, now he churns out straight to DVD rubbish. This film was made in 2008 yet due to major studio issues it wasn't released until last year 2012! now that's unlucky.

To be honest the film isn't all that bad, there is a nice spiritual Buddist/Hindu flow through the plot which is simple yet effective. Its an easy going 'Scrooge' type affair really, Murphy is a fast talking slick literacy agent ('Jack') who stretches the truth to make his deals. He gets his comeuppance when he tries his usual spiel on an Indian Guru and ends up getting cursed. 

The curse being a Bodhi tree appearing in his garden, from there on every word 'Jack' utters a leaf drops from the tree, the tree dies as the leaves drop...and so does 'Jack'. Once 'Jack' realises his situation the tree only has 1000 leafs left, thus he must try not to speak anymore and hilarity prevails.

Seen something like this before you say? yep you would be right, the plot is very much like Jim Carrey vehicles 'Liar Liar' and 'Yes Man'. In fact this film could have easily been a Jim Carrey vehicle, the plot is perfect for him, its virtually 'Liar Liar' all over again, to a degree. Murphy is wasted here as his best asset is his loud mouth, without it he's rather dull. The problem is Murphy doesn't have the rubber faced skills of Carrey (who would have fitted this much better) to fall back on.

The laughs are very predictable as you can imagine but as said Murphy can't really pull them off very well, he's not that kind of visual comedian. The plot is sweet but again incredibly predictable and ends up being very very mushy towards the end, in fact I still don't quite know what Murphy's character really achieves to reverse his curse. Cliff Curtis as 'Dr. Sinja' is a nice cast choice but you almost feel the role could be given to Morgan Freeman as the character is pretty much the same as his 'Bruce Almighty' role. Lets be honest the whole cast of 'Bruce Almighty' or even 'The Truman Show' could replace the cast for this film and it probably would have done much better.

Its nice to see some Hindu/Buddist imagery and religious culture in this film but that can't really save it. A bad choice in casting lets the film down hugely, on one hand it could have been a sensible emotional drama, on the other a great comedy. In the end its neither and simple below average, its annoying as there is a nice story in here too.",A Thousand Words

1,"Poor, shallow and insufficiently funny, A Thousand Words is a comedy, or actually a wanna-be comedy with interesting concept, but extremely poor execution. Still, while being torn apart by the most critics and audience, this Eddy Murphy vehicle is definitely not the worst movie of him. It is surely a huge disappointment and far away from being a hilarious comedy, but it manages to at least deliver the message of becoming a better person.

The story is quite formulaic and predictable. A top professional is so selfish and work-obsessed that he forgets to cherish his family, colleagues and the basic values of our lives. Then, by the power of the magic he is left with only 1000 words before he dies. A tree pops up in his garden and a leaf falls down from the tree with every word said by Murphy. From that moment the audience is taken to a mildly funny (some smiles are cause, but no real laughs), family friendly trip to help Eddy Murphy preserve his life.

Probably the biggest problem of this movie is Brian Robbins' choice to cast Eddy Murphy for this role. Previous co-operations in Norbit and Wild Hogs does not necessarily mean that Murphy was the best for Robbin's delivery. Shutting the mouth of the Hollywood's funniest voice, of the actor whose verbal aggression and verbal charisma are his trademark is a totally absurd decision. Murphy as well as the audience suffer from this choice and another actor would have been much more appropriate for this movie.

A Thousand Words is a bad movie. Not so bad as the ratings suggest (despite the fact that all possible directorial choices have been so wrong) it has some positive features.  As a whole it is actually quite passable for a family Sunday afternoon. The moral part of the story, the existential catharsis of Eddy Murphy and the mild dramatic load would very good suit every family searching for a lazy afternoon movie on the TV.",A Thousand Words
3,Not bad......not bad @ all.....,A Thousand Words
5,"Clearly, among the reviews here, I'm out on a limb by myself on this one, but I like this movie!  I don't know what expectations among others were not satisfied, but I came to this Eddie Murphy film thinking that I would have fun watching it, and I did!

If you're looking for something to take seriously, better look somewhere else - this is just frothy fun, with some helpful moral messages nicely fit in, along the lines of honesty, respect, and consideration towards others, and the importance of family.  

And, there is some truly beautiful cinematography, wonderful use of light and colour in some scenes.  

Eddie Murphy is wonderfully expressive, regardless of the medium - verbal, physical, or otherwise.   Actor Clark Duke is delightful, with quick responsive wit,  showing a depth of loveable comedic character as he plays Aaron Wiseberger, Murphy's character's assistant.  

As the much lauded Roger Hebert, in his thorough put-down of this movie, appears to have missed several points of information that were shown clearly within the movie, I wonder whether he actually watched it, or does he have research assistants watch movies for him and pass along their comments?   

Of course, there is plenty of absurdity in A Thousand Words, bits that don't make sense, but that's not a weakness, friends; that's a main point!  This film is of a genre called C-O-M-E-D-Y.  And some comedy, for the info of unfortunate folks raised on laugh-track sitcoms, is subtle, and some is just silly.   There is a good serving of silly in this one.  

Regardless, if you feel like enjoying a little light fun, with some actually important sentiments included, then forget the negative critics, whatever their agendas might be, give your rational, analytic mind a rest, go ahead on and enjoy this pleasant little morality-play comedy.

3,"I didn't find this as bad as everyone else. It was different & I liked the premise. It's definitely not Murphy's best by any stretch of the imagination, but it's alright. I enjoyed it :)",A Thousand Words
2,"not horrible, but goofy enough to keep it from being good.",A Thousand Words
4,imagine no talking for 3 days ....IMPOSSIBLE!,A Thousand Words
1,"Een vreselijk dom script, met grappen die nergens lijken te werken omdat ze simpel op te lossen zijn, wat ook voor de logica van de film is. Murphy mag niks zeggen anders sterft hij, wat al geen positief idee is voor een pro-life komedie over  een familieband die verloren is, maar dat hij ook gewoon dingen zou moeten opschrijven wat alles zal kunnen verhelpen. Ondanks dat dit oorspronkelijk is gemaakt in 2008, het is voor mij 1 van de slechtste films die dit jaar is uitgekomen.",A Thousand Words
5,"One of the greatest mafia films to have ever been made. This film is vastly underrated and deserves the credit it deserves. The entire cast did an outstanding performance particularly Armand and Anthony Quinn. Going through the film you feel the workings of the Gambino family and the camaraderie of John Gotti and his crew. As one former mafia member put it, it is the most authentic mob movie he's ever seen.",Gotti
2,"The true story of one of the biggest gangsters in America directed by Robert Harmon presented by HBO Pictures
John Gotti played Armand Assante rises to head the powerful Gambino crime family before being convicted in 1992 of racketeering and murder
Starting in 1973 Gotti is the head of an old mafia crew but wants to break a few of the family rules 
Being known as the Dapper Don for his expensive taste in suits, and the Teflon Don because none of the FBI charges against him will stick
He slips through like cracks through the wall ruling an empire
Life is good, but suspicion creeps in, and greed, rule-breaking and his high public profile all threaten to topple him
There's so much talking in this 
Yet Assante really brings John Gotti to life as he makes his way from transaction to transaction seeming untouchable 
Sooner or later every king falls from his throne",Gotti
5,There is nothing wrong with this movie.. it‚Äôs amazing. And free in HD on YouTube!,Gotti
5,Maybe one of the greatest mob films of all time. Great casting and a great script really makes this film shine. Armand Assante and Anthony Quinn are great together.,Gotti

5,Armand Assante was great.,Gotti
4,Great  in all departments.,Gotti
4,great and 1 in top 5 mafia movies,Gotti
4,"Armand Assante captured the essence of Gotti in a way that few could.  Anthony Quin and William Forsythe (in the roles of Dellacroce and Gravano, respectively) were the essential pieces that allowed the film to breath and be the successful character film that it was.",Gotti
4,Acting is always good in this film. Even the minor characters shine-- such as Ramone as the consigliere.,Gotti
5,My favorite HBO movie of all time. In my opinion this movie ranks right up there with the mobb movies infact looking back on it this should have been released  on the big screen but sadly it wasn't . Armand Assante  played Gotti perfect I don't think nobody could have pulled it off like he did. The rest of the cast did such a great job they all ended up on the Sopranos. It kills me every time I watch this movie the first time is when Aniello Dellacroce dies mainly because he was the only one John would listen to and the second one is when Sammie turns snitch . If you get a chance to see watch this movie and you like mobb movies you should enjoy this movie,Gotti
1,B-o-r-i-n-g.  S-L-O-W.,Gotti
2,I like the actor Armand Assante but this movie wasn't great...not bad just not great.,Gotti
2,"This isn't a very good movie, capeesh? Cartoonish -- capeesh? In closing, that's a some a spicy a meatball.",Gotti
5,one of my alltime favorite movies,Gotti
3,Watchable made for TV mob flick. Armand Assante does a fine job.,Gotti
4,One movie i can watch over and over again for some reason.,Gotti
3,"Richard Harmon's Gotti enthrals with the first frame. Brilliantly acted and directed, especially for a made for TV movie, Gotti is one of the finest made for TV films that I have seen in quite some time. Starring Armand Assante is a standout lead performance; Gotti is a brilliant drama about the Teflon Don, and his rise in the Gambino Crime Family. For a small production, Gotti is a very good film, one that is elevated by an impressive cast of talented actors that really make this a terrific viewing. The story at times is a bit unfocused, but you see glimpses of what makes for an effective gangster movie, if the film would have had a bigger budget, a more ambitious script, then who knows where this film could have gone. The film has its shortcomings, but it overcomes them with a powerful performance from Assante, who is perfect here. Like I said, due to the film's limitations, Gotti relies on the cast to really push the film. The result is an accomplished, and entertaining made for TV movie that is a well crafted affair for those interested in a good low budget gangster picture. Of course, the budget constraints show, but that doesn't stop this from being a worthwhile, well acted picture that is sure to entertain viewers for a pleasant time waster. For what it tries to do, it's one of those films that deserves more praise, and it's also a finely executed made for TV film that is far better than others in the genre. Considering that it's a film that uses minimal elements, it's able to pull off an entertaining two hours and it's a film that ranks among the finest made for TV films. Gotti isn't perfect, but the performances, story, direction and over all execution are what makes this an entertaining genre picture.",Gotti
4,Based on the life of John Gotti. One of the best TV movies made on the Italian mob genres. Armand Assante as Gotti is very convincing.,Gotti
3,"Although I had high hopes for this one, half the film was over and there was something missing.  Probably for me it was REAL star power.  This bunch of HBO guys, for the most part, are recent celebrity, if that.

Were it not for Anthony Quinn's stellar performance what do we have?  We have Gotti (1996).   That's all, nothing much more than every recent cliche mob movie.  I could barely understand the dialog for all the profanity, slang and New York city accents.

My take on ""Gotti"" the movie is this,.... spend your time watching GoodFellas instead.  It's claimed that this Gotti film was the forerunner of The Sopranos.  That's not saying much to me. It was like a diving board into a dry pool.

 Anyone new to mob films could be impressed, but not me. Like I always say though, every film has its fans.  Some of you more familiar with the actors will possibly enjoy this more.

5,"Can be compared with mob movie greats like Donnie Brasco, Good Fellas and Casino. 
Well written.
Well acted. 
Great ensemble cast that works. (and works well)",Gotti
3,"Pretty decent take on the rise and fall of one of the most beloved organized crime bosses. Unfortunately, it lacked any real excitement and drama like other mobster films. Armand Assante's performance as Gotti was amazing though.",Gotti
4,"Very solid film, as well as a historically accurate account of the life of John Gotti",Gotti
5,any movie w/ armande assante is awesome!  he's wonderful,Gotti
4,great acting job  Armand  Assante as Gotti,Gotti
5,"Dark Acting, vivid re-inactments, and blows Godfather Out of the Water! My 1 Stone* Favorite (TOP10)",Gotti
3,For the subject matter I felt that Gotti told the story of the rise and fall of a Gambino crime boss rather well. The characters drew me in extremely well because near the end of the movie I found myself outraged at Sammy for being a stooly. A nice surprise when expectations are tempered.,Gotti
2,watching The cast of actors act was worth watching. The movie itself was ok.,Gotti
4,"Gotti is a gritty, well acted, and complex look at the rise and fall of John Gotti. I thought Armand Assante did a terrific job as John Gotti, slick, bombastic, but also nuanced. It's inevitable to compare this to Witness to the Mob. Witness to the Mob was superior from a factual standpoint, covering much more ground in its' three hour run time than Gotti. Ultimately I'd have to go with Tom Sizemore over Armand Assante for the most accurate depiction of Gotti, as Sizemore mastered Gotti's flare of arrogance and naivet√© to an extent that Armand didn't quite get up to. At the same time, William Forsythe as Sammy the Bull was superior than Sammy's portrayal in Witness to the Mob. His personality as cold, calculating, and ambiguous, surely matches Gravano more closely than the positive spin Witness took on him. Overall, Gotti is better from a filmmaking standpoint, with sharper, more realistic dialogue.",Gotti
3,the rise and fall of the ambitious gambino crime boss john gotti..............done brilliantly by the uncanny resembling armand assante as john gottin,Gotti
1,"There's so much story here and yet this is almost free of story, what the hell? It's like taking a small bite from a fucking wedding cake and poorly and boringly conceived and directed.",Gotti
4,Great mafia film. This is the true story of La Cosa Nostra. Gotti is the story of the rise of gangster John Gotti through ranks in the Gambino crime family all the way to the top where he becomes the Boss/Don. Armand Assante gives a powerful and unique performance that is very true to life to the real John Gotti (he won an Emmy for his potrayal). Despite being a TV movie it was very well done and up there with other great mafia films.,Gotti
4,As a movie made for TV it's good but I think the man deserves a bigger audience,Gotti
5,"badly made, but Assante saved the movie",Gotti
3,Good movie. NIce to see all the actors from the sopranos in this flick.,Gotti
4,"I actually liked this movie.  It was a HBO made for TV made back in 1996.  The funny thing is this gangster movie has most the future stars of the Soprano's in it.  There was not a lot of action, but mafia movies are always fun to watch.",Gotti
5,"The best modern Mob movie!
Armand Assante as John Gotti is THE Godfather, second place from Marlon Brando. 
This movie had everything that makes a mob/mafia movie worth watching; respect, hits, loyalty, money, even getting away with crime.
Some very good Italian actors in this film that had starred in other similar films; Godfather, Sopranos, & Mickey Blue Eyes.

This is one movie that should not be missed!",Gotti
4,this is one of the best HBO films and honestly should garner more attention from the masses ... wonderful cast (watch for alot of sopranos cast in this) assante's dead on John Gotti and sadler's sammy the bull are worth the rental or even price of purchase for this dvd!!!!!,Gotti
2,Not bad HBO movie. Always nice to see the underrated Frank Vincent.,Gotti
3,"An overlooked maffia-film. Assante is no De Niro or Pacino, but he did a more than decent job!",Gotti
2,I was bored and couldn't get into this movie. I think it was because it was just like every other mob movie I've seen - there was nothing unique about it.,Gotti
5,"One of a kind, Gotti not the film. But i did like it very much.",Gotti
3,"this wasn't a theatrical release so i was afraid it was going to be a lame tv movie - sorry, i can't abide wiseguys that don't swear! but it was done by hbo - home of the sopranos (and if you know the show look for familiar faces)- and i gotta say they did a pretty good job with it. to succeed biopics have to strike a good balance of what to include and what to exclude and sometimes you get uneven results. i think they struck a good balance here.",Gotti
5,Excellent movie about John Gotti!  Armand Assante is awesome in this!,Gotti
3,"Straightforward gangster movie from the 1990s, with great performances of Armand Assante, Anthony Quinn, and others. On the plus side: very realistic, without too much emphasis on dramatic elements (except the death of Gotti's son). On the down side: plot tends to become a it boring after 90 minutes, as it usually does with biographical material. Nice to see for one time only.",Gotti
4,They wanted me to be something I was never meant to be......humble.,Gotti
5,Armand played the late Teflon Don to a T...they even kinda look alike.,Gotti
1,"Portrayed Gotti perfectly, everything else was not so perfect.",Gotti
5,"A great movie, and a great portrayal or John gotti and sammy the bull.",Gotti
5,"Absolutely awesome movie, and one Incredible performance by Assante.
Listen VERY carefully to the speech that you hear at the beginning and end of the movie, becasue the last part it true.
Great movie all around.",Gotti
5,its a great movie! well worth the watch!,Gotti
5,Great movie about the Teflon Don.  Armand Assante was great in his portrayal of Gotti.  I also liked William Forsythe as Sammy the Bull Gravano.,Gotti
5,The Sopranos before the Sopranos since a number of the actors appear in it. Great flick superb acting by Armand Assante.,Gotti
5,THIS RIGHT HERE IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE RIGHT HERE OF ALL TIMES.....BELIEVE THAT.,Gotti
3,another mafia extravaganza...,Gotti
4,"Gotti is very well produced and offers some very solid performances.  It's polished, first-person perspective flows like an extended ""Sopranos"" episode.
Aside from a complete lack of vilification of Gotti the criminal, the film has the chops to sit at the top of the mob-movie playlist.",Gotti
5,"for me this movie goes along with the likes of the godfather and Goodfellas and maybe even surpass them, and its way underrated",Gotti
5,this is my favorite movie,Gotti
5,based on a true life story the dapper and the teflon don john gotti murdered his way to the top by taking out mafia boss big paul castellano on december 16th 1985 then was made CAPO DU TUTI CAPI that means boss of bosses of every mafia family in the 50 states of usa the most he came boiss of the gambino family,Gotti
4,"A supa gangsta flick thats under rated! Assante was awesome and macho as always, aggresive hair trigger explosiveness with style, this flick is the forefather & backbone of the sopranos",Gotti
4,I think this movie is often underrated because it was made for TV. It was actually a great dramatization of organized crime and the acting was sharp!,Gotti
5,best movie ever made!!! number 1,Gotti
5,"I'm not a big Armand Assante fan,but he nailed it in this flick.",Gotti
3,one of my favorite mob movies.,Gotti
3,"Armand Assante, an actor who is often underrated. Here he shows all his talent and gives possibly his best perfomance. The true story of Gotti is truly a bizarre and interesting one. William Forsythe's performance is chilling and unnerving, that he cannot go without a nod. The direction and production value seem a little minimal at times, but that doesn't prevent the intriguing stoy from shining through",Gotti
4,Very good movie. One of the best mob flicks of all time.,Gotti
5,ITS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST THE MOB LOVE THE MOVIE,Gotti
5,Love this movie. Love any mobster movie. Underrated by far great performance by Armand Assante.,Gotti
4,"Tells of the rise and fall of John Gotti, last of the major Mafia Dons and loved by thousands to whom he was the ""King of Little Italy"". Great portrale of the inner workings of the Mafia with some great performances by Armand Assante as Gotti, the late great Anthony Quinn as Gottis mentor and William Forsythe as Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano Gotti's Underboss, Executioner, and chief witness against him. Must see for any fan of gangster pictures ""Gotti"" seeks to depict a man well aware of his flaws yet committed to them to the end.",Gotti
4,"Scott Cohen plays brother to John Gotti, and he's got steamy Pacino-like intensity. This Gotti family is like if Sonny were elevated to the top, and Michael were his lieutenant. Very intense, and fulfulling when the Teflon Don finally gets it in the end.",Gotti
1,Armand Assante is all I have to say.,Gotti
5,Its all about parameters!,Gotti

5,we all miss you john  from  ozone park queens n.y. your friend bill slattery,Gotti
5,You Goota See This Movie!!!!!!!!!,Gotti
4,"Actor Armand Assante was absolutley great in his interpretation of the famous dapper Don John Gotti. My dad, my brother and myself watched that movie togeather since all 3 of us are fans of mobster movies and this one was really a treat since it's a real life story.

John Gotti was the best example of the anti-hero but was really popular with the people and even though the man was a notorious criminal it was hard not to love him.",Gotti
5,"what, you movin furniture for five dollars an hour...he's the boss, you get it,he's the boss....",Gotti
2,A bit cheesy but not terrible. Assante was a bit over the top but Quin was stellar.  Filmed in Toronto....and it looks like it too. Basically an emotive history video of John Gotti,Gotti
5,"badly made, but Assante saved the movie",Gotti
5,"Armand Assante was amazing in playing Gotti, and this movie was a classic.  ""You know why the people of this city love me?  Cause I'm beating the same system thats fucking them everyday!""",Gotti

3,I read 2 books on him and just had to see the movie,Gotti
4,Ahhhh my childhood. Yes. I watched this as sophomore  and easily watched this HBO flick into the double digits. Loved the cast. Easily some of the best work by even some classic actors in this gem of mine,Gotti
3,a made for television version not bad but................,Gotti
3,"Gave this a 3 because the actors actually portrayed the Mob well. And they all LOOKED like the real people. However, anyone who knows about Gotti and the rest of the Family will know that this movies facts were all wrong or completely out of order. Still liked it tho",Gotti

5,"A great movie depicting one of the most flamboyant characters the underworld has seen. A must see for all mob film fans, in my opinion right up there with Goodfellas. It's a real shame not that many people know about this , a real hidden gem.",Gotti
4,true story truly amazing movie,Gotti
5,Great for an HBO flim,Gotti

4,I Learned something from this movie...,Gotti
4,"Damn near perfect, actor does a good portrayal of John Gotti! Loses half a star because it's made by HBO Films!",Gotti
3,"I remember a film called ""Getting Gotti"" with the extremely bad Lorraine Bracco which I'm sure was dire. However, ""Gotti"" is a lot better. It tells the true story of Mob kingin, John Gotti (Assante) and follows his rise and fall from the mid 1970s to his imprisonment in the 1990s. As a gangster movie, the familiarity with the storyline is instantaenous; plenty of double crosses, assasinations and organised pillaging - there are also many familiar faces from previous gangster flicks too. Assante is accompanied by his father-figure, Neil (the ancient Anthony Quinn), the respected DB (Frank Vincent) and his partner-in-crime, Sammy (Forsythe).

The cast are terrific and infact it is the strength of the characters which make this film stand out from the many gangster movies that sit on the video store shelves with Forsythe and Assante delivering powerful, commanding performances. For a change it is all accompanied by a decent script and is well directed with its 2 hour duration flowing steadily and without let-up.

""Gotti"" is one of the better action dramas for some time.",Gotti
5,I love this movie...,Gotti
3,"own it, evently i'm gonna own every gangster movie ever made",Gotti
5,"""There's no perimeters. There's no feelings. There's no feelings for this country. You got anarchy. So... 5-10 years from now, they're gonna wish there was an American Cosa Nostra. 5-10 years from now, they're gonna miss John Gotti.""",Gotti

5,"A Hidden masterpiece and just shows how brilliant HBO is at making adaptions of real life dramas..My fascination with the ""Teflon Don"" started when i saw this movie...mainly cause of Assante's brilliant potrayal  of the dapper don..however its not only assante..the rest of the cast fits like a diamond..Big Paul, Ruggiro..u see their mug shots and then watch the movie and be surprised as to how well the casting was done..and many of them later went on to play major roles in the Sopranos (check out Big Pussie and Paulie in Gotti!) though the movie does potray Gotti in a softer light than the actual ruthless gambino capo and boss he was, neverthelss its the only movie to date which does justice to the Gotti saga (which ended when he died in 2002 in prison)...be amazed at the opening scene..ive heard the actual tapes of Gotti's conversation tapped by the FBI(its there on the smoking gun website) and it must be said, just like there cannot be a better holmes than jeremy brett, i dont think that anyone can potray John Gotti better than Armand Assante..Kudos to him...""In ten years time they wish they had an Amercian Cosa Nostra..in five ten years time, they gonna miss John Gotti""...Salut!",Gotti

Secondly, the plot had SO much potential and they wasted it with overly-violent scenes and way too long fight scenes. Which is a shame because I love dystopian anything. The acting was terrible. The only one who was slightly good in this movie was Michael Pitt. The lead character (Edger something) I had seen before on the life story of Gianni Versace and he was good in that.

It's just your basic cliche-ridden action flick. But it reaches for originality and creativity, which is more than you can say for most. The acting is fine; Ramirez, Pitt, and Brewster serve the film well. Copley and Bergin might as well have been non-name actors for as much attention as they draw to themselves. The dystopian, Big Brother theme can never be overplayed, given the world in which we live. The only problem with it is the fact that we're supposed to be rooting for outright criminals for no other reason than that they're the ones the government is trying to stop. That's hardly a reason to make a hero out of Bricke; let's face it, he's a dirtbag. The only reason he's at all appealing is Ramirez's attraction.

1,"""The Last Days of American Crime"" presents a lot of violence and ugliness, but that's actually not the aspect of the movie that bothered me. This movie is a complete waste of an actually good concept. I think a more talented writer and director could have pulled off something complex and interesting. This movie fails on many levels and is a big mess. For one, it is way too long without ever justifying it. The movie spends a lot of time with exposition and world-building but it is so boring and poorly handled. A few action scenes do happen but I didn't care at all about the outcome. If characters died I felt nothing and there were no stakes I really cared about.

It's really not that different FROM countless other American action films except 
that in this case, it's not really 'good' guys going after 'bad' guys....
...In this case there aren't any 'good' guys at all- just a case of whose 
behaviour is the worst of all...If this were a film franchise with a favorite 
'name' actor in it, I believe a lot more film goers would be OK with seeing 
the 'baddest' eggs getting their just deserts...Perhaps also ,since the story
line was pulled from a graphic novel in which the USA was rapidly in danger 
of becoming a police state , which many of us believe is happening daily in 'real time',
that analogy has made many people uncomfortable with the amoral violence 
that happens in this film....Maybe if the Gerald Butler look-alike main actor 
had actually had that wildly popular action star in it, there wouldn't be so 
many negative ratings on this typical run-of-the -mill crime film...It's certainly

0,"Easily the worst film I have seen in a very long time and I found myself willing it to end after about 45 minutes which is when your brain cells start to die off from being subjected to this brain rot but alas it's over 2 hours long!

I'm not sure if anyone responsible for making this rubbish, actually bothered to make sure the basic story made any sense when it came to editing. As there are only a few scenes that attempt to bring the mindless shooting and explosions together to form some sort of plot, you would think they would try and do a good job on them but no. I will give some examples:

Hours before the heist They go to Pitts characters family home and kill his father for no reason at all, maybe just to add some pre-heist tension as he gets shot and is badly injured before the heist but even that doesn't work as he makes a miraculous recovery after brick leaves him bleeding out on the floor of a car park. I do recal them needing to steal some explosives so they might have been there for that purpose but it seems they forget to actually do that.

They finally break into the bank, 2 of them just get in a lift directly to the vault, one of them gets into the building disguised as a garbage man and the girl rings up a random guy who comes with no back story, and says ""I just didn't know where else to go"". That guy invites her in, without question, to the main control room for the signal thing and tries to kiss her?
So the guys in the vault room blow up the vault locks, the door opens and out walks....the garbage man???? Oh and he has a forklift truck in there as well. How they get out is just as a mystery as how the garbage man got into the locked vault as the scene just jumps from the vault to the corridor where they make their effortless escape. Not sure why they bothered blowing the door up if you could just walk in through the back?

The girl is an ace hacker tasked with the mission to dissable the signal thing. She goes to great effort to successfully disable it for 30 mins. When the signal comes back on it apears that Pitts character is immune to it so the whole story thus far is pointless. 
A ""good"" cop shows up to ask the girl ""what the hell is going on"". They had attempted to give this cop a back story but it served no purpose and I found myself hoping his question was going to be answered as I had no idea either. A fight scene broke out and he died.
The girl then goes back and blows up the server room anyway so hacking it to give them 30 mins in the first place was pointless if it can be permanently disabled.

Brick and the girl make their escape to Canada in a magical semi truck which barely has a scratch on it after a face full of military fire power and  concrete road blocks at the boarder and luckiy for them, the military just gave up pursuing them once they smashed through. After a minute of deep romance, brick dies and she lives happily ever after. Well she did manage to go and collect her partner in crimes ashes before hand but yeah.

5,"It is a rare occasion that you stare into a film and the film stares back at you. The Last Days of American Crime is a stroke of genius. The beautifully executed two-dimensional characters lul us into a false sense of security, tempting us to mock the film as the depths of cheap modern entertainment. But as the plot unfolds and each would-be action hero discredits themselves, we see the true cheap entertainment is the movie which our own simplistic expectations demanded. Megaton gleefully refuses to let the movie become a hero story or even a political statement as was Minority Report. When Sharlto Copley utters the words ""what the hell is going on"", it speaks not only to the tangled web of a plot but to our tangled post-post-modern reality. The Last Days of American Crime is not a fun summer blockbuster, though some may mistake it for such, it is also not an irredeemable pile of trash, as it has been called by many an unenlightened film reviewer. The Last Days of American Crime is a masterstroke, a challenge to our expectations as movie-goers, and it does not care what you think.",The Last Days of American Crime

2,"Even by relaxed standards which we judge widely-available Netflix movies during a time of quarantine, The Last Days of American Crime is a staggering waste of 150 minutes. It's based on a 2009 graphic novel series and even by the sliding scale of shut-your-brain-off action movies, it's numbing, dreadfully dull, incoherent, and stitched together with hoary genre clich√©s and little creative forethought. It's rare that I come across a movie that seems so willfully ignorant to explore the implications of its own premise.

In the near future, the U.S. government is in the final stages of implementing the American Peace Initiative (API), a special radio signal that stops crime in its tracks. It acts as a brain blocker on anything illegal, stopping the user from being able to follow through. Graham Bricke (Edgar Ramirez) finds out the hard way when his bank robbery crew become some of the first test subjects. American citizens are desperate to flee to Canada before the API goes live. Bricke gets seduced by computer hacker Shelby Dupree (Anna Brewster) to pull off one big score. The government is readying to destroy a billion dollars in currency before going digital, and Shelby's fianc√©, Kevin Cash (Michael Pitt), has the connection to pull off the heist of the century.

Firstly, there is not nearly enough material here to justify the gargantuan Avengers-esque running time. You could realistically slice down a whole hour and not impact its middling entertainment value or clarity. While I was watching it didn't even feel like a movie, more like a series designed to be binge watched, where the plotting becomes much more slack because the filmmakers anticipate their show will be digested in quick succession and that they have earned patience. It irritates me in television and it certainly irritated me here as well. Don't blithely assume that your audience has infinite patience when you haven't given them a proper story to properly engage with. Just about every scene could be trimmed down and some of them go on punishingly long, especially scenes where people are getting shot. There's one late scene that goes on for what feels like five minutes of just watching two characters get shot. It's so gratuitous, like much else in the movie, that it borders into unintentional anti-comedy.

As for the action, director Oliver Megaton (Taken 2 and 3) delivers very little of note. There's a car chase here, a shootout there, but no set piece that actually develops or proves that memorable. It's all just disposable noise that amounts to little, not even fleeting, escapist entertainment. This is a heist movie where the actual heist planning is ignored. The most enjoyable part of a heist movie is the intricate planning and then execution of that plan, combating the unforeseen complications and overcoming for triumph. If your entire movie is centered on a big heist, don't treat that like it's another meaningless plot element. I cannot believe the filmmakers failed to realize that if the viewer doesn't know what the dangers, problems, and scheme of the upcoming heist will be, then everything feels arbitrary and unsatisfying, and it does so here. The actual heist, pulled off around the 90-minute mark, is not worth the buildup and lack of accessibility. It's just another haphazard action set piece, not the culmination of planning and an important payoff for carefully manufactured setups. If you're tuning in for fun action, you'll be sorely disappointed to find there's more time spent torturing people onscreen than there is for sustained and exciting action.

The awful characters we're left to spend 150 minutes with are hardly worth that investment. Everyone is kept strictly as stock archetypes, and even when the screenplay tries to develop them, it follows a strictly predictable path to minimal results. Oh, someone has a family member in custody and is being pressured to snitch? Oh, our silent-and-seemingly-conflicted protagonist wants to avenge his dead brother because he cares and stuff? Oh, our oddball criminal scion wants to make a big name for himself outside of his father's shadow? The fact the movie spends so much time with these characters while giving them so little dimension, little personality, and little to do is another indictment on the bloated pacing. If we're spending this much time with our criminal rogues, the least you can do is make them interesting and dramatic and colorful. The protagonist's name is Graham Bricke, which sounds so boring that it must have been generated by an A.I. The femme fatale super hacker lady is really here just to look sad or sexy, here to deliver three uncomfortable sex scenes including a near rape as well. The other notable female roles in this movie include News Anchor, Lesbian 1 and Lesbian 2, Female Tweeker, and Female Cop. Hooray for depth.

There are two characters that had a chance of being interesting but are so mishandled. The first is Kevin Cash, our wannabe gangster. Pitt (HBO's Boardwalk Empire) brings a much-needed dose of energy and theatrics, like he's trying everything in his power to desperately hold your flagging attention. Even his pathetic overcompensating nature is tiresome. A scene where he, his father, and his younger stepmother (another fine example of female character representation in the movie) shriek and bicker at one another is just embarrassing and misplaced comic relief. He's boring. The only other potential was with Sharlto Copley (District 9) as a disgraced police officer. We spend plenty of time with him early in the movie, establishing his outsider status, perhaps some regret, and hoping that his position of authority will be better explored as he wrestles with whether the police force is worthy of its state-decreed exemptions to the API. Nope. He just becomes another dude in the final act that could have been replaced by anyone else. It would be like devoting so much time to Henchman #12 and his personal crisis of self in a Bond movie only to watch the lug unceremoniously die in a final action rush. Was that worth the time spent?

Its Purge-like premise sounds intriguing and worthy of exploration until, that is, you really think about how silly it all is. So a magic radio signal is going to inhibit your brain from committing known wrongs, but does that mean that the radio signal will have to blare constantly in order to have a lasting effect, otherwise its enforcement will be limited? What happens to sociopaths who don't even register right from wrong? They will be able to move and act without abandon. Then there's the day-to-day corruption, graft, greed from all pillars of society, politicians and Wall Street and officials that exploit their positions for illegal gains. Seriously, if this radio signal inhibits the fruition of illegal acts, would Wall Street just shut down? Would the factory owners who knowingly skirt worker safety for profits be able to operate? Would criminal defense attorneys be able to operate or would they use the ethical justification that everyone, no matter how heinous, deserves legal representation? If you think about a capitalist society, it's built upon people behaving not so nicely, so would all facets of the economy grind to a screeching halt?

There is one aspect of this world building, even with what the meager story has established, that could be interesting to explore, and that's the exceptions to this new order. Police officers are getting implants that make them immune to the effects of API, though in a world where a radio wave eliminates criminal acts, do you still need a police force to protect and serve? Regardless, this special class of exception is deserving of further exploration, a socially relevant angle to tap into the inherent advantages offered to the top one percent who don't think the rules apply to them. In fact, if Last Days of American Crime was going to run with its silly premise as is, and during the pre-activation countdown timeline, they should have presented a story about those who are given the state-sanctioned privilege to act with impunity. Let's watch the elite get their special exemption chips and plan for the New World where they maintain their vaunted privileges. It would at least make the movie socially relevant as well as a better development of its sci-fi premise.

Watch, dear reader, as I present you two better scenarios with this silly premise. The first is the most obvious and that's life AFTER the implication of the AFI, presenting life under a new fascist order and a group of revolutionaries trying to thwart the radio waves. Imagine a group not plotting to pull off a bank heist but ridding their community of the AFI and giving them autonomy over their minds and bodies again? There's an ever-present hostility that forces the characters to keep their thoughts on safe topics, having to communicate with subterfuge to not set off their brain jailers. It would be like a dystopian version of that classic Twilight Zone episode where little Bill Mumy where everyone had to think ""good thoughts"" or else he would magically banish them to the cornfield. That's interesting, that's genuine conflict, that's characters under great duress trying to escape a fascist nightmare without tipping off the invisible sensors in their own minds that could trigger. There's a larger goal of freeing their fellow citizens from this tyranny as well. That's already one hundred times better than simply trying to steal money before the clock strikes zero. If it was only ever going to be ""one big last score"" then why even bother with the mind-control antics? It could have been anything at all.

However, if you wanted something more low-key, you could take a different path with the idea of the bucket list before the API goes live. Think of two teenagers who don't have the means to escape and feel like they haven't fully lived and a whole lifetime of rebellion and adventures they had been dreaming towards will now be snuffed out. The screenplay already floats the idea of a criminal bucket list but why not run with that idea as the core of your movie? Two teenagers making the most of their time together over the course of one long crazy night of cutting loose, testing their boundaries, and acting out the best ways they know how, learning about each other and the depth of their friendship before their minds will not fully be their own. It takes the teenager coming-of-age model, feeling like a stranger in your own body, and gives it a PG-13-Purge twist, with the distant tragedy of the looming tyranny ahead to up the stakes. Even that development would be better than ""one last score,"" and these are just two ideas I've come up with while writing this film review. Think what could be accomplished if a professional screenwriter spent weeks fleshing out a better version.

Alas, the version of The Last Days of American Crime we do receive is powerfully plodding, incoherent, empty and arbitrary, and definitely not worth your precious 150 minutes. With the current state of the world where thousands of U.S. citizens are protesting in the streets over a militarized police state and wanton brutality, it makes Last Days look even more phony and ill-conceived as entertainment. It doesn't examine the implications of its own fascist police state, it only uses it as a pointless backdrop for an arbitrarily plotted¬† ""last score"" heist before it all just falls apart, spent of imagination and intent.

3,"I am not entirely sure why there is such extreme negative criticism of this film. It is a well made film based on a graphic novel that is in a style of classic American crime and action films with a dystopia police state future. It reminds me of films like Shoot 'Em Up, Crank, Death Race, and Children of Men. It is great to see studios putting effort and budget into adapting non family friendly graphic novels.

People really need to realize that giving such harsh reviews unnecessarily to films adapted from graphic novels will only discourage studios from adapting more comic books/graphic novels into film.

Aside from a few slow moments in the film it is actually a decent crime action film that's well shot, well acted, and you can tell they took it seriously. Also Michael Pitt was great in this film and feel he was the stand out actor in his role.

I've read a lot of negative reviews based on police brutality and riots being in the film which is the dumbest excuse to give a film negative reviews. So you're telling me that the people who started making this film years ago were trying to make a film that was what, mocking our current state of the country?!

It was extremely hard to find many positive things to say about this hunk of junk. And besides a decent musical score, I cannot recommend enough that you skip this movie. Megaton's The Last Days of American Crime has a plot that could have been squeezed into 80 minutes...Instead, we got about 2 hours and 30 minutes of pure crap.

Well... a very shakey psuedo-scientific premise that broadcasting a specific frequency would target an area of the brain that deals with asocial thoughts and prevent one from acting on them?

I don't think the Director knew either but then, given the screenplay, that is hardly surprising. I was ever hopeful that the actors might drag something out of the mess but they seemed to be sleepwalking through their lines and the awful (and seemingly gratuitious) set piece 'shoot outs'. It became particularly laughable (and embarrassing) when Brick and co went to the king pins house where the son had an argument with his father. Not only did this 'argument' not make any kind of rational sense, it didn't assist in moving the plot forward at all and seemed like the actors were... acting. Wooden does not begin to describe it. It was a pure hodge-podge of unrelated and irrelevant scenes that only kept me watching as I wondered how much worse it could get.

1,"After the Christmas time murder of her youngest son Sean by a great white shark, Ellen Brody joins her surviving son Michael and his family to their home in the Bahamas. After suffering trauma induced dreams and visions, and a shark showing up in the Bahamas, Ellen becomes convinced that the shark is targeting her family. 

The film gets a lot of stick for a revenge plot, but, to be fair, it never outright states this is the case- it could be Ellen's trauma driving paranoia. 

What should be noted though, is Mario Van Peebles' accent, a weird focus on Michael's sex life with his wife who is rubbish at metal sculptures, the shark spending a weird amount of time on top of the water, and a final confrontation in which it appears to repeatedly ROAR and, depending on which ending you get, reveals that compressed gas and grenades from previous films were redundant, as sharks are naturally explosive. 

Michael Caine makes it worth watching alone. From telling a story about a one armed pianist to a family who just lost a member to a limb ripping shark attack, to his mysterious escape from the jaws of death (""it wasn't easy!""), he's still full of charisma and watchability. His short interaction with Judith Barsi is actually quite charming, and there's a bit in her first scene where she swings off a door handle on arrival to her grandmother's house which is basically the best thing in this film.",Jaws the Revenge

3,"JAWS:  The Revenge gets a really bad rap.  I think the biggest thing is to not compare it to the original.  The original 1975 JAWS was lightning in a bottle never to be re-created.

This is a far off sequel to both JAWS and JAWS II and I would say that this one takes place some 15-20 years after those events.  We follow the lives of the brothers, Shaun and Michael Brody, and their paranoid mother Ellen, who has become extremely paranoid over the years concerning the ocean and sharks that seem to be bent on destroying her family.

The story is fun ... is it realistic?  No, but you have to remember this is a movie and if you nit-pick every little detail you can turn any movie into a failure.

Watch this movie and appreciate it for what it is ... a sequel ... and NOT the original.  I would however, HIGHLY recommend finding the version of the movie where they did not use the ""Blow up"" death of the shark ... because the exploding version doesn't make any sense and should have NEVER been substituted in!",Jaws the Revenge

0,"0 out of 5. This film should be studied by everyone to understand what makes a terrible movie and a terrible sequel. The cinematography actually is ok camerawork and lighting wise. It's the fact that the scenes themselves are filled with either boring nonsensical scenes or outright batshit insane plot scenes that makes it bizarrely terrible. The music isn't good either, its a mix of boring generic cinematic music and the actual Jaws theme with literally no change to it from the first and its barely used. The editing and pacing are horrifically bad because its filled with boring subplots about Michael and his Mother that literally contribute nothing to the plot and are not well acted. The acting slowly gets worse in this. Easily Michael is the worst character and is terrible and makes just a dumb choice to not tell his family about the shark and never gets scared. Making the Mother have a telepathic connection with the shark is one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard of for a character in a movie ever. The special effects are terrible as the shark is constantly stiff and looks fake even more so than the other films. It's such a shame because this is such a nice location this takes place in as well. The dumb choices characters make like not going to the final confrontation without any weapons, the dumb ways characters are written, the SUPER DUMB plot, the horrifically boring middle of this that contributes nothing to the plot, the bizarre in between movie backstory of what happened to Roy Schneider, and no tension in the slightest makes this one of the worst sequels and films ever made. You know I have to say the worst part for me wasn't even the Roaring Shark or the dumb plot...it was the beyond BORING subplots in the middle of the film where Michael and his Mom have there romance subplots and family issues...It's soooo boring. I'm honestly recommending this though for anyone who wants to learn what makes a terrible sequel and a bad movie in general.",Jaws the Revenge

5,"So, a 4th Jaws movie who wouldve thought, even after the disaster that was Jaws 3D the studio decided ""hey the problem with that movie is that we did it in 3D let's try it again and get rid of the 3D but still keep the awful writing, direction, acting, cinematography, editing (some of the shark kills are so cheap and choppy sometimes it's ridiculous don't even know whats happening) and the blatantly obvious visual effects my god they made practical effects look bad how does one achieve that? I'm more impressed than disappointed. Even the title doesn't make sense it completely contradicts an important line in Jaws 2 where a scientist points out ""Sharks don't make things personal Chief Brody""  however this shark has so much vengeance in him he swims from one ocean to another, that's not even possible for a shark for fack sake. Its as if they only did this for money‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. well, we all know Michael Caine did and I respect him for that. I first saw this movie when I was about 9 years old and even then I switched it off after 20 minutes and if you can't even entertain a snotty 9-year-old kid who's obsessed with sharks then you've failed on a catastrophic level. 
They even straight up copy scenes from the first film for example the sweet and endearing scene when Brody's son mimics his movements and facial expressions well suck out all the soul that scene had and plaster it in this movie, do you get it? We're being relatable this doesn't come off as lazy in the slightest. They even steal the final scene where the sharks corpse sinks to the bottom of the ocean talk about hitting rock bottom‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. (Sorry not sorry)
This movie manages however to find the perfect balance between depression and hilarity. The effects are awful don't get me wrong however they make the film entertaining, but the ending is one to be desired. Depending on which version you watch there are two endings one where the shark stands up on its tail out of the water and explodes when it gets lightly touched by the boat and you can tell it's a miniature model of the shark especially when you pause it at the right moment and the far superior ending is when the same thing happens the shark ROARS and stands up on the water as if its Jesus Christ himself and the boat just stabs it then the shark just dies and spews blood everywhere it is comical which is why as much as I hate this film I would only watch it drunk.
Overall, it's a sad sombre sitcom with a shark as a guest star. the saddest part though is that its memorable for all the wrong reasons. Watch it drunk or high or even both that's the only way to watch this utter garbage.

0,"I didn't see Jaws:The Revenge until recently, after hearing so many bad things about it. And I do wish I left it alone, this has a reputation on the whole as being one of the worst sequels ever, and as far as I'm concerned that reputation is deserved. Steven Spielberg's Jaws is brilliant, not only one of his best films but also the very movie that made me afraid to go into the sea.

Jaws:The Revenge didn't have that effect on me whatsoever. In alternative to giving genuine scares and thrills, the whole film is laughable. Especially in the plot, which is really quite inept, and in the climax, which is the epitome of WTF? Jaws:The Revenge also has some embarrassingly cheesy dialogue and poor pacing. Then there's the direction, Spielberg's direction was one of the many things that made the 1975 film so good, but the direction here from Joseph Sargent is incompetent.

The production values don't fare much better. The locations are quite nice but the cinematography and lighting are altogether unexceptional. The music is also disappointing, whereas the music was what made Jaws so unnerving in terms of mood, it was way too gimmicky here. The less said about Bruce the shark the better, he is not menacing at all, instead he is one of the many laughable assets of the film. Also he is not used well at all, and there is little to no build-up or suspense whenever he appears on screen. The acting is atrocious, the only actor who tries and the only redeeming quality is Michael Caine who deserves better. Lorraine Grey is annoyingly neurotic, while I was shocked that the talented late Judith Barsi would participate in such a mess, and her talents aren't even put to good use. Don't get me started on Mario Van Peebles, him, his character and his comic lines are annoying and get old fast.

Overall, a terrible film and one of the worst sequels I've seen and I have seen a lot. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Jaws the Revenge
2,"Man, people really hate these last two sequels, eh?

I don't even think 'Jaws 3-D' is as awful as most fellow reviewers think and that's the case again with 'Jaws: The Revenge'. It's bad, but it's not *that* bad. It makes little sense, though to be fair it is from a franchise that is all about a huge human-killing shark; despite sharks, in fact, not actually being all that keen on our rotten flesh.

Michael Caine is somehow in this. Well, I say somehow... a trip to the Bahamas and a nice paycheck likely made it entirely logical from his view; as he reportedly stated himself. Lorraine Gary, meanwhile, spearheads an average support cast. Speaking of whom, I did find their dialogue and interactions to be very unnatural and forced.

2,"I am only giving this a two star rating with how funny it is. It's so obvious they were trying to make a good film. But the studio was in a bind from the previous year that you can read about it online. Mostly the studio and the people involved making it laughed at the idea that they were trying to beat the clock with only five or six months from being released. They weren't prepared. Shocking as that sounds, they didn't have any time to think things through. When the movie came out, it shows that they acted from the director Ed Wood, with only one or two shots and they had a produced film that wasn't even 90 minutes. Run, gun, and get it done. Everyone can complain about the shark, or how terrible the dialogue was. Reading the book of this film made it more substantial and they should've included that part from the book's perspective. They knew they were in a bind, but hopefully could make it work. When you watch the film, the majority of people knew it was bad, so they tried their best at it. Now, given that I've seen the movie multiple times, little kids will love it. Adults will chuckle at how bad it is, and it ends with a climax that's all over the place. I admit, I can tell what they were thinking of...but they shouldn't have included scenes from the first film to counteract with what they were representing in the fourth film. It's in poor taste. Yet, I found myself enjoying this movie for a lot of reasons. The opening with the deputy, the ongoing battle with the shark, and hearing Michael Caine going, ""Oh sh*@!"" The shark goes after a banana boat, the iconic music score, and JAWS goes after a plane. The idea taken from the book that it's two sharks is quite ideal. One was upstate only they have a voodoo priest call upon terror with a new shark located near where they lived. Why they didn't include this scene it would've made it more tolerable in the long run. As the franchise killer, it was terrible then and more terrible now. If they explained that Lorraine Gary was out of her mind and hearing things, it'd be okay. But I think we will get a reboot of this franchise. Call it JAWS: MERCY. It would be a complete antonym for the damage they caused with the Revenge as title. As a movie, I can honestly say I can watch it over and over. But as a good movie, it's not definitely not that.",Jaws the Revenge

Its a confusing pointless work of crap. The chase scene was bad, you can even see the rig connected to the shark at one point, like come on. It was poorly written and executed...lets not forget the ending which thet ruined.

1,The first two Jaws movies were good movies and then the third movie while not so good still had a creative premise and decent acting from Dennis Quaid. This movie's plot makes no sense whatsoever and doesn't explain how the shark follows the family from the USA to the Bahamas. Sadly this was Lorraine Gary's last movie which is a shame because she was a really good actress and I hope to see her comeback in movies.. The late Richard Jeni had a hilarious bit about this movie that is much worth your time rather than anything from this movie.,Jaws the Revenge

The director of this movie actually said the reason it was so dumb is because they were thinking they should use a little tiny bit of magic or something like that since they knew it would never be as good as the original so they wanted it to be as unique as possible, and not to mention they were given barely anytime to make the movie which probably added to some of it's glaring flaws, the ost is amazing tho definitely my favorite arrangement of the iconic theme song. Overall I enjoy myself with this movie due to being easily entertained and liking it's ridiculous premise.",Jaws the Revenge

Or at least that's what I thought until I finally watched this wonderful series. The first, an iconic moment in movie history.

2,"For completeness I had to endure this 'last' as of reviewing film in the Jaws franchise.
Permanently scarred after watching Jaws 3 and after seeing the aggregate scores I feared the worst for this viewing but I have to say....IT WASN'T THAT BAD!
Okay it is nowhere near the cinematic highs of Jaws but is a decent 4th entry. I mean compare it to Superman IV: The Quest For Peace!
Michael Caine makes a career defining appearance that achieved it's objective of paying for a new holiday home!
I started by watching the trailer on You Tube. Any trailer that has a Blondie song 'One Way or Another' as the soundtrack is funny.
That was how I approached the film. Funny.
Not as a major comparative piece of the merits of the first film (which it does allude to with pictures and discussions mentioning Chief Brody (Roy Schieder).
The main sticking point regarding this film is the thought of a Great White Shark travelling thousands of nautical miles to the warmer climes of Florida to just get revenge on the Brody family! The sheer thought is preposterous!
The film was made super quick in 1986/87 in an era before CGI and it shows. The models of the shark are awful. A primary school student could do as good a job to be fair.
The sequence at the start of the film where young (new) Chief Sean Brody is mauled is quite good and bodes well for the rest of the film.
Going back to 1987. It was a great year for sequels of major franchises! What with this, the already mentioned Superman IV and even Timothy Dalton debuting as James Bond in The Living Daylights where did the year go wrong!",Jaws the Revenge

1,"I read an interview with Michael Caine once on how he selects which films to appear. If I remember right, he one looks that whether the role is different from what he last played and two he looks at where the movie was being filmed. I'm guessing he chose to appear in ""Jaws: The Revenge"" because of latter for it's warm Caribbean setting. How could there be any pretense that this was going to be a good movie when the poster tag line is, ""This time it's personal."" How is a shark going to take things personally from the prior three films? And when the shark got killed in all of the prior films, is this film's shark supposed to be the third cousin twice removed coming to get revenge on Chief Brody's wife (the only person from the original film appearing in this fourth installment). There is no reason to watch this film outside of put camp. It's awful and is only watchable when the mechanical shark appears.",Jaws the Revenge

I mean it's just filler and we only get to see 3 people die in this movie...yeah that's right, ONLY 3 KILLS: UNCLE SHAWN, THAT CHICK ON THE BANANA BOAT AND THE FREAKING SHARK HIMSELF!!! And of course, it makes no sense. I mean...HOW DID THE SHARK FIND HIS WAY FROM UNITED KINGDOM TO THE BAHAMAS IN OLNY A FEW DAYS!? HOW DID THAT BLACK GUY SURVIVE AFTER THE SHARK BLEW UP!?

The plot is ridiculous and Lorraine Gray is terrible (but part of this is the writing).  However, Lance Guest delivers a strong performance, and Michael Caine brings a nice levity to the film.  Also, the shark effects aren't that bad, though there's no real menace or sense of terror to him (as he's really only after the Brodys and whoever gets in the way).

0,"It occurs to me that the worst thing that can ever happen to a comedian is to reach a point at which the general audience moves from ""What has happened to you?"" to the lower depths of ""How do you keep getting work?"" Such is the commentary on Adam Sandler whose recent spate of disastrous press over his summer box office comedy Pixels have finally given his money men a wake up call that the theaters for his movies are basically empty. Why they didn't catch on to this - I don't know - 12 movies ago is beyond me.

Personally, I've never liked Sandler, even during his heyday on SNL. Yes, he sold albums and was a box office star, but he grated on my nerves. His persona reminds me of that irritating kid in English class who sat behind me and made duck noises with his arm pits while amusing himself with annoying voices. In his movies it's the same idea; the only difference is that on the screen he's getting paid $20 million for it.

Sandler is not without talent. Under the direction of Paul Thomas Anderson he turned in a brilliant comic performance in Punch Drunk Love a decade ago, and more recently with Russian-born animator Genndy Tartakovsky they made Hotel Transylvania. Good pictures. Yet, he refuses to follow that same trail, and recently he has famously been using his company Happy Madison to fund movie projects so he and his friend can take trips to places he wants to go, like Africa (Blended), Las Vegas (Paul Blart 2) and Toronto (Pixels) and Hawaii (Just Go With It).  Fine, but the result is that he stick his audience with movies that are destroying his already shaky reputation.

Now realizing that the movie theater is no longer a viable option to his laziness he has now taken his cinematic indifference to Netflix for a planned four-picture deal. The move does nothing to improve the quality.  Entering into his first Netflix venture, a laughless chunk of indifference called The Ridiculous 6, did not fill me with confidence especially with reports that the movie was so offensive that a handful of the Native American actors simply walked off the set. I get that, but I don't find it offensive to the Native American culture so much as movies in general.

The plot is more or less superfluous. It's a parody, I guess, of every western movie from Dances With Wolves and Unforgiven all the way back to A Man Called Horse about a half-Indian man dealing his dual identity. Sandler plays White Knife, a saddle-sore who was raised by Apaches and learned superhuman fighting skills. His white father Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte) goes missing and that puts him in contact with his five brothers: Chico (Terry Crews), Herm (Jorge Garcia), Lil' Pete (Taylor Lautner), Ramon (Rob Schneider), and Danny (Luke Wilson). That's a thin line on which to hang jokes that are either gross (one character is nicknamed ""Beaver Breath"") or just plain baffling - the opening credits called this The Ridiculous 6 - in 4K! What? I don't even get it.

If that didn't tickle your funny bone then the rest of the movie will leave you in stone faced indifference. We get a burro who projectile defecates. We get an extended gag in which a man scoops out his own eyeball. There's Vanilla Ice playing Mark Twain. There's one character so dumb that he thinks that babies are defecated out their mother's womb. Blake Shelton shows up as Wyatt Earp for no reason. There's baffling gag in which a man is stabbed in the leg with a carrot, which comes right after the appearance of a gang of thugs so tough that they have each removed their right eyeballs - that's funny, right? Meanwhile I sat through this movie with the strange urge to do the same thing (it has that effect on you).

And right in the middle of all this is Adam Sandler who manages to sleepwalk through this movie with a measure of indifference that made me depressed over the fact that he was getting paid. If I did that on my job, I'd be fired. His character isn't consistent - one minute he has an accent and the next minute he doesn't.  Sandler's line-readings sound like he's reading from cue cards and then gives up halfway through.  There's no joy of performance. He doesn't care. His scenes are lazy and unfunny and give you the basic urge to be anywhere else.

What he and his team have created here is not satire; it's a badly structured series of unfunny episodic sketches that feel like they were written by a 12 year-old with ADD. As the Native American stereotypes, I wouldn't worry so much about that because if you culled everyone who could find offense in this movie (whites, blacks, latinos, women) we'd be here all day - I guess you could call it an equal opportunity offender. I spent 119 minutes with this movie and another half hour writing this review. That's 149 minutes out of my life that I am never going to get back. You just spent 10 minutes out of your life reading this review.  That's 10 minutes out of your life that you're not going to get back.  Sorry about that.",The Ridiculous 6
5,"Right... I must be one of the only people who like this movie. This is one of my favourite movies and, in my opinion, the comedy (while being immature and slightly offensive) is EXACTLY my kind of humour and I think that it is done really well. People need to stop taking the jokes too seriously and reading into them if they think they're too offensive. Because to be brutally honest, you're going to have a bad time if you're offended by this movie. I've said my piece. Don't @ me",The Ridiculous 6

I think Rotten Tomatoes is so biased with people that are wanna-be critics with that proverbial stick up their butts that I don't use it as a serious source to gauge movies or ""films"" as pompous a**holes say anymore. I think The Ridiculous 6 was more watchable than either ""Wrinkle in Time"" (deserves 1/5 for crap story and delivery) or ""I kill Giants"" (which isn't engaging or surprising at the end whatsoever). The problem is people give children and family, and not to mention indie movies way too much credit. That, and there's way to much focus on indie movies with all of those hipster fanboys around. Get off your soapbox, get a real job, and take entertainment for what it is, Entertainment. God forbid you laugh and live a little. If you're a tight ass, and you don't understand the extremism of parody, and you're of the modern persuasion that's offended by like every f***ing thing, then this isn't the movie for you.

I'm glad my expectations were in the toilet, though, because I ended being a lot more impressed with this movie than I thought I would. No, it isn't Shakespeare, but it is not even remotely the worst Adam Sandler movie ever made. The cast is huge, the directing is quite impressive and the locales are big budget. The construction of it is not bad at all. Sure, it's offensive as hell in parts, but, again, it's an Adam Sandler movie. Everyone is offended and stereotypes are abused. From black penis jokes, lazy Native American jokes, greasy Mexican jokes to stupid white guy jokes, the point of this Adam Sandler, and if I'm not mistaken, ALL of his movies, is to completely ridicule everyone to the most offensive extent in the name of sophomoric humor.

The Ridiculous 6 is a stupid, unfunny, juvenile, lazily written steaming pile of horseshit, The characters are all stupid. The jokes are horrendous and super lazy. This movie is a disgrace to all Western films. Adam Sandler seriously needs to stop being in movies. Almost all of his movies are bad. He only has 4 good movies. I heard this movie was so offensive that the Native American actors walked off the set. I would rather stare at paint dry for 2 hours than watch this movie. Why the hell did Terry Crews agree to star in this atrocity? I hope Terry Crews isn't friends with Sandler. If I was allowed to give this movie a zero star rating, then I would.

I spent months on end breaking down this film and I have come to an accurate conclusion. The film cannot be such a garbage comedy. Yes! It has a deeper message.

Considering Adam Sandler finds himself to be the butt of most of the jokes, you can't help yourself from wondering if he's okay. There may be some doubt. But have you seen his bloodshot, glossy eyes? True pain is in there, folks. True pain. This all leads me to believe that this is, in fact, Adam Sandler's suicide note.

This was dark, dark, dark.  Watched it twice to appreciate its complicated plot.  Who cares about any original story (which Hollywood always savage with fiction and whimsy, anyway) ... this transports you into the gray grimness of The Poland That Stalin-build despair.

You sissies who scurry back to the ordinary and hackneyed didn't deserve such a noir tour-de-force.  Special credit to Jim Carrey who, whether or not you like any of his roles, is an underutilized talent who refused to remain the Charlie Chaplin of his generation.",Dark Crimes

2,"I found this movie less bad than the reviews here on Rotten Tomatoes would suggest. It's a pretty grim testimonial to the failure of communism with everyone wearing horrible clothes, having manky teeth, looking undernourished, miserable, unkempt and repressed. In that sense, this movie is very accurate and consistent in its gloom. Jim Carrey's default is gloom ...unalleviated gloom....inconceivably so. Nobody could be that full of gloom and still function.

Like many movies set in non-English speaking countries, for some reason everyone speaks English with a foreign accent. I mean, this is just plainly and simply daft....a bit like the old war movies where all the Germans spoke in awful broken, accented English. And they're still making movies that do this??? So Jim Carrey speaks English with a Polish accent, as do nearly all of the other characters....... yep, if they were really Polish and for some reason living their lives speaking English to each other then, sure, they'd all do so with an accent to some extent. But these are supposedly Polish people, with Polish names, living in Poland and speaking their native language to each other.......so why the daft accent? 

I ended up fast-forwarding as it started to drag. Then reminded when I missed the punchline. And then thought.....""so what?"" 

This movie passed a bit of time but I must say, apart from the accurate gloom of the sets and props etc, it didn't have much going for it.",Dark Crimes

Yes, it's Jim Carrey in a dark, dramatic role, and he was spectacular doing it.  I never had a doubt he could do ANYTHING and extremely well.  Yes, the tale is dark, sordid...that in and of itself will definitely NOT appeal to many people.  Most people won't be able to get past that part, and judge the film on it's other attributes.  I like a film with twists, and this one had several, including an ending I did NOT see coming.  Basically, professional movie critics cannot be completely trusted, typically it seems they find it their purpose to find fault and negatives in a movie.  And many audience reviewers are simply assholes about it.  I certainly don't trust their's completely either.  Nor should you trust mine.  See the film and draw your own conclusions.  I loved Jim Carrey's performance and I hope he does more of this type of film.  I wouldn't label this a thriller, it did not have that affect.  Rather, though, I found it interesting to watch, not boring in the least, and actually gut-wrenching in parts.  The fact the type of sordid behavior portrayed actually exists in our world is at once disturbing yet painfully true.  Oh, and let's not leave out Charlotte Gainesbourg's typically fine performance; always extremely sexy, a terrific actress.  This isn't La La Land, and it's sure as hell not Pet Detective.  And, yes, perhaps it appeals to some's (perhaps mine) dark, sordid side, like straining your neck when you pass a car that has crashed to see if you can see any bodies.  Oftentimes reality in your face is challenging to see, but some of us prefer to not deny it.  I can see why many wouldn't like this film.  Reality for some is just too hard to watch.",Dark Crimes

It is a who-done-it type that left my husband and I intrigued throughout the entire film. There were twists that I never saw coming and I felt Carrey's character's desperation and hurt.

It's extremely hard to sit through this film knowing how capable the director and the amazing cast to do so much better than this, that's ultimately why Dark crimes is a botched thriller, the only sliver of good is Carrey's performance and the showcase of his wide range as he displays his ability to do a demanding dramatic role.

1,"Jim Carrey makes a return to the big screen in a movie that suggests the filmmakers never once looked at the actor's resume. Carrey is, at his worst, a gurning, hyperactive idiot that chews scenery like he hasn't eaten for weeks. But when sufficiently reigned in, his comic energy and physical aptitude are mesmerising. He's done dramatic work before, most notably in Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. In that he gave a retrained performance that still allowed him to use his gift for humour to add levity to the proceedings. In Dark Crimes he gives his most underpowered performance ever. The film is set in that magical region of Poland where everybody speaks perfect English and only has the faintest of accents. The premise is inherently fascinating, but it quickly losing its edge when you realise it's a blatant rip off of Basic Instinct. Carrey wanders through Europe's greyest cityscapes, trying to catch a killer while attempting to set the record for fewest words uttered in a motion picture. At first I couldn't work out what kind of accent he was doing, or if he was just doing his regular voice with subtle inflections. But after a short time I came to realise that even he probably didn't know what he was doing. The movie drags itself from dull plot point to boring exchange of dialogue, all culminating in one of the most head-scratching endings in recent memory. It's a very inauspicious comeback from Mr. Carrey, an actor I've frequently enjoyed over the last few decades, and I just hope he manages to find a film more befitting of his skills in the near future.",Dark Crimes

Consequently, he is unrecognizable as Jim Carrey: His look, his voice, his mannerisms, his body language all bespeak a remarkable transition as an actor that most people never would have expected from this actor.   Many comedians have tried this transition and failed.  As a matter of fact, Carrey has failed in the past, but this time, Carrey's skill as a serious actor is masterful.",Dark Crimes

3,"I watched STRATTON this weekend. Well, I got exactly what I expected. A generic, cliche, geo-political, conspiratorial, espionnage action thriller. I saw this movie with this exact mindset, and I got what I've come to expect.
So, the positive points with this film. 
Well, for starters, the action scenes are not bad. Yes, you heard (or should I say read) me correctly there. The action scenes are not at all bad in this film. As an action junkie myself, I've seen all too many movies with choppily-edited scenes, infinitely minute frame-rates and unwatchable shaky-cam. This movie, surprisingly, had none of those. It was just decent action, and dare I say it was even a bit enjoyable. So there you have it for action.
The actors are pretty good in this movie. I think that Dominic Cooper is a seriously under-rated actor, and he and the rest of the cast did a good job. 
The plot is thin but bearable. I mean, you can watch the movie without rolling your eyes out because of the plot.
Now, I only have three major issues with this movie.
The first issue is the lack of character development. Everyone in this movie is just blank. I mean it. They are all the same, and not even Stratton stands out. Look, here's an example. Stratton will risk his life to save millions of people or save a fellow comrade on the battlefield. However, later in the movie we see him tie up an unarmed man (who has a family, by the way), leave him in a building and intentionally blow it up, thus killing him. We literally have two opposing personalities, and I just couldn't help but noticing that characters were just absolute crap. Same for the villain. His motives are never explained. He's just bad because he is.
Secondly, the pace. Now, the action is good. We talked about that. Nevertheless, there were moments when there was serious drag in this movie, and it was boring. There would some cool spy stuff going on one moment, and the next Stratton would be having a casual stroll in the park with someone and talking about boats or the weather.
And last, it's the fact that this movie tries to take itself seriously. It is most probably low budget, and it decided to have a bio-weapon-threatens-to-destroy-London plot, international conspiracies, and even decided it was cinema-worthy. NO! This movie is not cinema-worthy. And whenever the characters even try to read lines to render the movie MORE SERIOUS, I nearly laughed, because it just DIDN'T FIT.
Look, this would have been a perfect direct-to-DVD film. It tries to take itself seriously. Does that make it a bad movie? Of course not. I even had a good time with this movie. But it's not something to get excited about. Watch it if you can find it on-demand, otherwise, you can leave this one be.",Stratton
3,"Opens like a video game. 
It's standard stuff. 
Worth a watch if there's nothing else on  
Doesn't tax the watcher",Stratton
1,A decent cast just can‚Äôt be arsed to give a decent performance as they are let down by lack of budget and poor writing. Connie Nielsen English accent is one of the worst put to screen. Plods along I guess and is short so you prob won‚Äôt get bored you‚Äôll just lose interest pretty fast so it becomes nothing more than background noise,Stratton
1,"While it is fun stupid action, exactly what you would expect. I find the lack of attention to detail to annoy me more than the stupid predictable plot entertains me. For example. In the first scene, the two operators both have grenade launchers on their weapons which you never would have in a black ops mission. And when they then get chased by cars none of them actually uses their grenade launcher. And in the boat chasing scene the sight he has on his gun is a holographic 1x sight, but when the viewers see the reticle it is a Russian style sniper scope.",Stratton
1,"Stratton has to be one of the most generic and boring spy thrillers I've seen, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Similar to James Bond, John Stratton is a main character in a series of spy thriller novels and this movie is based on that character (I'm not sure if this film is based off a particular book in the series or not). In this movie, Stratton and his partner are sent in to destroy a facility containing a deadly biological weapon, but things go awry when key intel is wrong and all the scientists and guards are already dead. Terrorists are waiting to ambush them and the deadly chemical ""Satan's Snow"" is already gone. Now, it's up to Stratton to figure out what the terrorist are planning to attack with this biological weapon and try to stop them before it is too late.
 
This is normally the type of movie I wouldn't bother watching. It seemed like something that would either go straight to DVD or you might find in a bargain bin, but I was looking from some movies that hand January 2018 US release dates and I noticed a few names I recognized in the film. I wouldn't call them A-list stars, but Dominic Cooper, Tom Felton, and Thomas Kretschmann are actors I recognize and have liked in sole roles. I didn't realize until after the movie that it was directed by Simon West who directed such movies as: Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, When a Stranger Calls (2006), The Mechanic, The Expendables 2, and The Rick Astley music video ""Never Gonna Give You Up"".
 
There are at least a few good things I can say about the movie. For one, I do like Thomas Kretschmann's performance as the main villain in the film: Grigory Barovsky. Kretschmann is a character actor I respect, even if it might be in more bad movies than good ones. He makes a great villain for the film and the villain himself is the most interesting and formidable character. This is one of those cases where a really good villain is wasted on a bad movie.
 
I found that by the third act came around; the film was more bearable to sit through. I wouldn't consider the action anything special at the end, but at least it was more acceptable compared to the first couple of action sequences in the film. The third act of the film really picked up, it's just a shame that it felt like a slog to get to that point.
 
I also like the opening theme of the movie. The music sounded like something you might find in a James Bond film. For reference, I'm talking about the music that's played when the studio logos are being shown. The next bit of music played during the opening credits is quite catchy as well; even if it was being played over clips liked looked more like a DVD title screen rather than opening credits. Unfortunately, the rest of the musical score or soundtrack in the film is bland and forgettable.
 
Everything else about this film was boring, forgettable, predictable, flat, or poorly executed. When the opening mission started, I was positive Stratton's partner would die on the mission. Everything about how the scenes played out and how the two of them interacted made the partner feel like nothing more than an extra that always dies on these missions. I was surprised he wasn't chopped to bits in the pipe they had to swim through. Instead, the movie had him die at the very end of the opening mission and tried to get us to care about his death. He felt like he was nothing more than an extra in the film, and yet the film wants you to be extremely sad or angry about his death, because apparently Stratton and him had a long history of being buddies and partners. I just found it incredibly funny when it cut to the escape helicopter rising up and Stratton hammering his fist into his partner's chest. Stratton karate chopping his dead partner's neck and then screaming in his face ""Wake up, Marty!"" was just the cherry on a hilariously bad moment. Stratton's partner isn't the only character lacking the character development needed for us to care. Practically every character, including our main character Stratton, is dull and has nothing to them that helps us care in the slightest. We learn virtually nothing interesting about Stratton or who he is as a character.
 
So, clearly this movie isn't a character driven story or a character study. The movie focuses on the plot and hopes that will be engaging enough. However, the plot is far too predictable and generic. It also doesn't help that scenes are film in such a flat and dull way. It's almost impossible to find the plot engaging. The only time the plot is remotely interesting is the final act of the film. The shootout at the beginning mission has too many jump cuts that it felt chaotic to watch. The car chase after the shootout had to be one of the slowest car chases I've seen on film that isn't meant to be a parody. If it wasn't for the hilariously bad moment of Stratton trying to revive his dead partner, I might have shut off the film and not bothered reviewing it.
 
As you can probably imagine, there is some really bad dialogue in the film, especially the ""banter"" Stratton has with his partner at the beginning of the film. The acting is mostly phoned in or really bad. One particularly performance has to be from Gemma Chan who plays Aggy in the film. Gemma Chan is good in Crazy Rich Asians, but I imagine she had nothing to work with in this role. She's so robotic and bland in this film. I might go so far as to say she had the worst performance in this film.
 
I really don't think there is any reason to see this film, especially when there are far better action movies and spy movies out there. It might not one of the worst films I've seen this year, but it's surely going to be among one of the most boring films of 2018 for me.

2,"I  wish the whole movie was as interesting, as the first mission, the 
main character goes on. Slowly but surely though, the film starts to turn into a made for TV action movie. The production company could have copied and pasted, the last twenty minutes from any other action film, into this movie. Then used CGI to put in their own actors. They could have saved themselves time and money. 
It might just be me, but Dominic Cooper, doesn't seem like a good choice as the star in this project. It  could of course just be, that no one in the cast, is required to do any real acting. Gemma Chan, was about as animated as she was in the TV series, where she played an android. Derek Jacobi, must just have been in the neighborhood, and the producers said something like, ""Hey Mate, if you're not busy. Want to be in a scene or two in our movie""? Of course, they probably just called his agent, to see if he had a little time to kill. Lastly,
I would have much preferred the actor, that played the first American serviceman. To the one that played his former team member. I can't say more, because of ""spoilers"".",Stratton

4,"This is a 1960s Bond style thriller in a modern clothing. It doesn't have the glamour of the franchise Bond stuff, nor the Bourn series, but it seems as if is actually more true to life. No fab CGI, no over blown locations. I found it refreshing.",Stratton

The SEAL replacement who is a petty officer 2nd class, shows up as a chief petty officer.. Nice cracker jacks with a corpsman 2PO rank insignia while carrying a chief's cover. Big fouled anchor, you can't miss it. I know this is primarily a Redcoat movie, but I have one question.

I feel bad for the actors, unless they got big checks.",Stratton
0,"So this is the SBS, is it? Not very good, are they? Still, on a budget this small what do you expect?  It's the Bourne Identity filmed on fifty quid. A usually talented cast are given very little to work with and manage to do even less with it. The lines sound like they'very been dubbed from a thousand miles away. The exposition is awful. Classic example,  a techie asks what happens if a fan turns back on while our heroes are swimming along a duct. Er......come on. And the acting! The scene where Stratton is described as a maverick - massive yawn - is so badly scripted and acted it borders on self- parody. And who goes to the pub and recites rude limericks and laughs?. No one, for those of you still puzzling over the answer to the fan/duct question. Terrible stuff.",Stratton

2,"I could never understand the hate for Michael Bay being a rubbish director. Yes, I get it about the objectifying of women, but about supposedly not contributing anything good to the world of cinema is strong, especially when we have directors like Simon West in comparison. I know that's a pretty harsh knock and whilst I actually enjoy some of his movies, I can't see anything new that he brings to the screen using techniques and trickery we've all seen so many times before. 

He directed Tomb Raider, The Mechanic, Expendables 2, All mildly entertaining but never being at the top of their genre; and I have a personal distaste for Con Air. Wild Card and The General's Daughter are the only two I actually rate, but my enjoyment from Wild Card is probably down to fight coordinator, Brad Martin. So, when I see West as being attached to direct anything I go in with fairly low expectations. 

The film is a possible franchise adaptation of the titular novels penned by Duncan Falconer, a pseudonym for the former SBS commando. While the film doesn't inspire me to read these novels he was contracted to write by Time Warner starting back in 2003, it does make me wanting to read what got him the attention in the first place; his autobiography ""First into Action"" about his service with the Special Boat Service and other elite intelligence units. 

For those of you not familiar with the SBS, it's not cheap a ripoff of the SAS as some might disrespectfully assume. The Royal Navy's elite force actually precedes the Army's SAS, but let's not get this into being a competition. Falconer was one of nine marines, out of 147 candidates to make the grade of Commando and served 12 years during The Troubles with Northern Ireland and the Falklands War, including high risk operations in Palestine, the rest of the Middle East and Africa. 

The reasons for my detail on the background of this film is because the character of John Stratton is quite unique from your usual espionage hero. Unlike Bond, Bourne or Hunt and Mills. Stratton is very much a character based on a real person; Falconer. It even touches on Stratton's childhood which is a mirror image of Falconer's own. Of course, this storyline with be heavily dramatise in comparison and the IRA have been replaced with different terrorists to suit the current climate. 

We follow our protagonist into the world of covert operations, in attempt to stop a potentially lethal bioweapon being set off by an international terrorist cell. Paired up with fellow Navy SEAL, him and team go on a fairly decent paced hunt across Europe chasing a former FSB ghost. 

Dominic Cooper takes the lead as Stratton and I do wonder what the real life 'Stratton' thinks of his performance. Originally the part was Henry Cavill's who dropped out prior to filming due to artistic differences with the script. While many might be upset with the exit from Cavill, Cooper performance isn't the let down the here. In fact, apart from Nielsen's dodgy posh accent that makes her sound like an intoxicated Eva Green, all the performances are up to expected par. I thought Chan was brilliant and Stowell added a Hemsworth quality to his part. 

What does let the film down majorly is the poor editing and the sound in some parts. The vehicular chases are good and real enough, reminding me a little of Ronin. But the fight scenes and shoot outs are not as dramatic as they should have been. It's unpolished which doesn't make any more real or gritty but flawed and shows bad editing in attempt to flesh out the sequences. And, what actually pushes completely off balance is Nathaniel M√©chaly's over dramatic score. 

It isn't terrible, I've seen far worse, but it doesn't give me any more hope for West as a director. It had great potential to be a good addition to the likes of Bourne and Bond, and I would welcome a franchise to honour Falconer's life and work. But lets have someone else behind the camera.

3,"I watched the film directly after listening to the audio book. What made the book enjoyable was the characters. The story was very much secondary. The movie was interesting to watch because it was interesting to see 2 hours of story extracted from 21 hours of audio book... it was an interesting summary of the plot. But very very badly done. The worst thing about the movie was the best thing about the book... the characters. The film needs to have been something like Seven. And for me the main character in the book was Keith... the actor who plays Keith is terribly inappropriate for Keith both in terms of his physical attributes and oh my god his terrible terrible acting (mugging I think it is called). In the book Keith is evil, but you end up liking the character, not the person, and his catch phrases and his strengths and weaknesses, his either/neither and his such-likes... he should have been Sasha Baron Cohen's Grimsby. Guy and Samson were spot on. In the book Guy has so many funny episodes but they were ALL missing from the movie. Samson. Nicola is almost more of a plot device than a person in the book, a force of nature. In the movie she is cryingly bad, like someones teenage daughter wandered on the set and tried to act (and Keith is someones teenage son doing the same). Nicola in the book has poise and confidence and is crazy, Amber Heard is just a stupid. Their was nothing of Keith's family life, or his car, or his shed. Or Guys home-life, and Marmaduke and his interactions with the nannies and also with Keith and Nicola, and Lilly Boo etc etc. The movie should have been focussed on the intensely edgy scenes that took place between the characters. It focussed on the wrong characters and the wrong story, But if you have read or listened to the book it was interesting",London Fields

(Not a surprise it hangs down in the gutter per RT along with most of my favorite movies) It's not mainstream relatable.",London Fields
4,I think I understood it...,London Fields
1,"In an effort to be deeply noir, this film just meanders along with good actors speaking really bad dialogue.",London Fields
2,"Every once in a while, you come across a film that you know little, to nothing about, but it's premise is so intriguing that you just have to check it out.  London Fields was that film for me.  Prior to four months ago, I had never even heard of this film, but after seeing the trailer and reading the synopsis, I knew it was something that I'd have to experience for myself.  And no matter what the critics say, and that includes myself, this is advice everyone should follow, as the subjectivity of film is what makes it such a beautiful experience.


London Fields tells the story of Nicola Six, a clairvoyant femme fatale who can see people's deaths before they happen... including her own.  She meets three men - Samson Young, an aging writer desperately seeking inspiration for his next book; Guy Clinch, a rich aristocrat looking for happiness in his life; and Keith Talent, a ne'er-do-well with a penchant for playing darts - one of whom she knows will be her murderer.

I really dug this premise.  It sounded interesting and unique, and with the stacked cast it has, I felt like it would at least be a consistently interesting film.  Unfortunately, it falls a bit flat throughout, not quite living up to its potential.  I loved the idea of a modern neo-noir, which isn't something you see too often.  And for the most part, it hit that tone beautifully.  But there were some uneven parts that pulled me out of the film at times, particularly the scenes with Keith (Jim Sturgess) toward the end.  They just didn't fit for me.  It felt like a completely different movie with a huge tonal shift, which made it more difficult to get back into the rest of the film.  And even though I love Jim Sturgess, I felt like he was a bit too over-the-top with this character.

On the flip side of that, Theo James' character, Guy Clinch, was a tad boring.  Only towards the  end did he start to liven up, but it was just too little, too late at that point.  I wish he had shown more passion throughout the course of the film.  I was also a bit turned off by his home life.  He has this almost psychotic child who he and his wife (played by Jaimie Alexander) don't even seem to bother trying to handle.  It was a bit off putting, and the fact that he wasn't actually played by a child was even more odd.  Also, I was excited to see Jaimie Alexander in this movie, but then disappointed by how she was so underutilized.  Even Cara Delevingne, who was also underutilized, had a better role here.  And we even get a little bit of Johnny Depp doing what he does best with another quirky, and somewhat intriguing character.

The other two main stars in this film were Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton as Nicola Six and Samson Young.  I actually liked both of their performances here, outside of some bad dialogue.  I felt for these characters.  I was interested in seeing their stories unfold, even if it was a bit predictable.  They had great chemistry with one another, especially during the scenes where they're just hanging out talking.  It was refreshing to see them like this, in non-sexual situations, as most of the movie was centered around sexuality.  And speaking of the sexuality in this film, I was pleasantly surprised that it really didn't feel tasteless to me.  It never got overly gratuitous, which can be difficult in a film like this.

One of the things I loved about this film, however, was the score.  The jazz noir music was a perfectly beautiful fit, which set the tone in a way that only music can.  Every time those saxophone notes would hit, it locked me in.  I'd love to see the film noir genre have a renaissance, bringing with it this infectious style of music.

Overall, I feel London Fields was a bit of a misstep, failing to live up to its full potential.  It has some redeeming qualities, but I just wish it had had a stronger structure, and a bit more character development.  If the premise and/or cast intrigues you at all, go see the film.  Judge for yourself.",London Fields

As i see it all around the web, there are controversial mixed opinions regarding this film. Usually ""my way or the highway"", no shades of gray, so i'll try to be objective (even though i DID enjoy re-watching this, remembered it from my childhood, it was magic back then).
<a href='http://www.postimage.org/' target='_blank'><img src='http://s3.postimage.org/kesz550ws/return_to_the_blue_lagoon_movie_poster_1991_1010.jpg' border='0' alt=""return to the blue lagoon movie poster 1991 1010"" /></a>
           
        I don't really remember the first part or whether i liked it or not, but all i can say is that watching this, i awakened some of my childhood memories so it kinda felt great. Whatever happened with this film that made it receive such hugely underrated ratings...i have no idea, n'or do i care. This is one of the few nicely done romantic films i've grew up with and it's impossible to forget Mila's sexy young wet body from when she was 16 years old. I fell in love with her then, and i did again now. It's slow paced but i'm sick of speed every now and then, fuck those eye stealing sfx, and enjoy a chilling romance on a tropical island. Trust me it's quite interesting watching 2 kids, boy and girl growing up all alone, to discover EVERYTHING together, no help, no nothing, gets...steamy.

          Downside is, it feels boring now, i spoiled the magic it had, guess my brain only functions on cgi chemistry atm..damn, also i didn't expect much from this film i knew exactly what it is, but damn there's a lot of talking...ah well i still kinda liked it. Enjoy!

Picking up right after the first film's events. The boat is found by a passing ship and only the baby has survived. The only woman on board takes charge of young Richard until suddenly they are forced off board with another crewmember, her daughter and Richard because there is an outbreak of cholera. After days at sea with no hope the crewmember tries to throw the children overboard and she kills him. Soon after they arrive at the island from the first film and grow into a handsome Brian Krause (Sleepwalkers) and the gorgeous Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil). Along the way incidents happen and soon enough they are faced with civilization. It's all dramatically engaging, romantic and suspenseful at times. It all moves forward towards a thrilling climax. The movie is shot gorgeously with solid performances. It still holds up as a intriguing romantic adventure.

I'm a big Milla Jovovich fan so I watched this on netflix streaming on xbox360 when I flicked by it.  Suddenly I felt like a pedophile with all the young Milla half naked scenes. She seems about 15 in this movie! Its snoringly boring and a cheese fest. The first scene is totally implausible they get stranded by way of purposely being set adrift on a British ship because of a cholera outbreak. So to save thier lives they put these 2 babies and a women ADRIFT at SEA in a tiny rowboat!?  Batman is more plausible! Or zombies! (instead watch all Milla's awsome zombie/sci fi movies!)

This movie might be romantic if you are a 12 year old mormon girl from 1985. At the end the 2 lovers get rescued but instead decide to stay on the island and raise thier baby all alone on an island by themselves!

I loved this film when I was young.",Problem Child
0,"In brief, I hated this movie. I hate this movie with every particle of my being and I will never cease to resent it. I hated it back when I was a wee lad with no moral compass, I hate it now, and I will always hate it. The plot is about a sociopathic, relentless psychopathic child who has been returned to his orphanage multiple times for awful behavior and wreaking havoc. Some couple that can't have children of their own decides to give him a chance only for him to continue being a Dennis the Menace rip off, an actual devil and a horrible individual to those who adopted him for one more time.
I have nothing to add to my review but hostility towards this absolute piece of garbage marketed towards the family demographic. It is horrible and mean spirited, taking the ""naughty child"" premise where no man has gone before. It does not hold back, everyone. It does not leave the elderly, dogs, cats, houses, criminals, parents, nuns, baseball teams and stores in peace. This absolute garbage of a character tornadoes his way through all of the aforementioned, causing chaos for the sake of non existent cuteness. And yet, after all of this destruction, the father remains adamant and still gives the spoiled little sh*t a second chance in the end, after he defeats the hopelessly useless and innocuous villains of the movie in a cute, comedic kind of way that always gives Junior an unfair and illogical advantage. Apparently the 80s-90s were the time when the concept of a child with a personality of a chainsaw was a nice chance for the creation of a cash grab with little attention to laughs, detail, acting, screenplay, virtually everything. The cinematography is bad, the acting is horrendous, the premise and screenplay is the worst I've seen in a while, and the execution does not help at all, how is a plot where a child gets his grandpa in a wheelchair supposed to even be considered funny to someone? Even when I saw it back then as a child, I knew it was wrong, I hate it. 
I have nothing more to add, everything about this movie is bad, there are no redeeming qualities, maybe some nostalgia value but that's basically it. I strongly discourage you from even considering watching this steaming pile of horse cr*p.",Problem Child

0,The WORST movie I've ever seen,Problem Child
1,"I know some regard Problem Child as a guilty pleasure but, on the whole, this movie didn't really work for me. Sure, John Ritter delivers a solid performance and there are a couple of jokes that stick the landing, but this loud, mean-spirited, immature comedy didn't have me wondering if the 0% on the Tomatometer was warranted. Yeah sure, Junior's behaviour is a product of circumstance what with everybody immediately giving up on him the moment he does something bad. And this world is treated as a terrible place to live, albeit of a comedic variety. When you stop to think about that, can you blame Junior for looking up to a recently arrested serial killer? This movie works best if you see it as the type of movie a bratty kid would make. Yet, while the unpleasantness wasn't as appalling as in other comedies I've seen, Problem Child just didn't really do it for me.",Problem Child
5,It was so funny it had me laughing on the floor,Problem Child
5,"Here's the thing, everything about this movie is true. It is a mean spirited movie that has a lot of stupid stuff happening in it, but I remember being a little brat myself in the late 90s and early 2000s.

It's not that hard to believe the writers got away with a pg rating seeing Back to the Future had tobacco, alcohol, and sexual scenes and still got a pg rating.

4,He was a problem child. Yes he was mean spirited and his pranks were juvenile because he was in fact a child which I found the director captured perfectly.

It does have a few good funny moments but there are way better comedies out there.  MEH/AVERAGE 2.5/5 OR 5/10",Problem Child
5,"The movie that I watched was called ""Problem Child"". I really liked the movie, in fact, this is one of my favorite movies I've ever watched. It's about a little boy named Junior, who was in an orphanage full of priests, and he always wrote letters to the Bowtie Killer. Junior was adopted by Ben and Flo Healy, and Big Ben lived with the Healy family. Junior was not a nice person, but it was kind of funny to me because he would be sneaky and do sneaky things to certain people. For example, he destroyed his own room and ruined a little girl's birthday party because he was just a bad person, he wanted to be like the Bowtie Killer. So I really enjoyed this movie and I could watch it again.",Problem Child

I have seen another comedy that I thought was awful and so did a lot of people. Even this poorly done film isn't worse than that. Why a sequel was made I have no idea. Do not waste your money buying this film. It is a complete disaster.",Problem Child

Acting is not really great either, but the movie is a nice iffy kids flick.",Problem Child

Now that I am much older, I watch it and laugh AT it. The pranks Junior plays are funny, but otherwise this movie is just plain weird! Same goes for the sequel--very predictable, corny jokes and sappy ending (except the sequel's end was better.) Regardless, this is kind of a decent movie and is still enjoyable.

The cast was great, especially Michael Oliver as the problem child!!  He plays the world's most craziest kid and yet, he makes you still like him!!  If you like movies that represents the title of their movie extremely well, than check this out!!  If your looking for a comedy with a magnificent story, than look elsewhere!!  This is absolutely a must-see!!",Problem Child

5,"Ben (John Ritter) and Flo Healy (Amy Yasbeck) want a young child of their own, but Flo is incapable of having a child herself. Enter Junior (Michael Oliver), a little monster who has been to foster parents' homes since he was a baby and always made himself get thrown out so one day he goes to the orphanage and causes trouble for the poor nuns (although some of them deserved it). So Ben and Flo go to adopt a child and the administrator, Peabody, cons them into taking Junior off their hands. Junior goes home with the Healys to a nice house which includes a bedroom full of clowns! Ben takes an immediate love to his son, no matter what the horrible things he does, even though he injured his grandfather (Jack Warden), a bigoted politician, really turned a birthday party into a ""blast"", sicks a bear onto campers on a camping trip, and even goes on a joyride with convicted killer Martin Beck (Michael Richards)!

also stars Peter Jurasik, Charlotte Akin and Anna Marie Alfred.

0,"Uninspiring, lazy, thoughtless, and unfunny in every regard. This is yet another one of those movies I watched over and over again as a little boy and now see that it is not good at all. Dennis Dugan's directing, the terrible writing and juvenile jokes, and Michael Oliver as the little brat make this a painful experience to get through. Michael Oliver is not likeable at all in the film and you just want to hurt him when he is doing some prank to something and Dennis Dugan failed to launch a real career for him like Chris Columbus did for Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone. John Ritter is a likeable actor but he is squandered under a mediocre as hell script and in the second half of the film after Junior drives through the sports shop, his acting got a little too silly and over the top in my opinion. Amy Yasbeck as the wife of John Ritter's character was annoying and over the top and I wanted her to shut up when she would be yelling something and half of her dialogue is whining and complaining. Gilbert Gottfried here also annoys you with his squirmy face and his silly voice. Dennis Dugan is one of the most untalented directors working today and throughout his whole career he has been directing the same old juvenile recyclable crap. In the end, if you feel like losing some brain cells and having an unpleasant time, than this is the movie for you.",Problem Child

3,"This movie was much originally written to be a dark comedy. Although the movie still has some of these elements. I guess, it was re-written to be more of a family comedy. But it is pretty mean-spirited family movie. Despite all that, it manages to be pretty funny at times. John Ritter certainly gives his best as a truly nice guy, who wants to be a parent. 

Michael Oliver as Junior is a hoot, his acting might not be the best. But he has some amusing moments. For Ritter, he did get to meet his future wife, Amy Yasbeck as his spoiled wife Flo. The only mistake, i see the ending feels truly rushed. The movie has an short running time. Some of the deleted scenes were added in the television version.

 ""Problem Child"" did manage to have an cult following over the years. Especially those, who grow up watching this movie, when we were kids ourselves. When Junior writes a letter to Mr. Bow Tie Killer (Michael Richards) is one of the biggest laughs of the movie. Director Dennis Dugan went on to be an successful comedy director and he has directed some of Adam Sandler`s better comedies.",Problem Child

1,"aside from a few funny parts here and there, this movie has nothing to offer me. Very ""high school play"" quality acting in this film. And not to mention a somewhat twisted moral behind the plot involving accepting people for who they are.

0,"Awful, uninspired comedy about a brat, this is one of the worst comedies I had the misfortune of seeing. Poorly written, acted and directed, this is a film that never was funny to begin with. I never understood why this film was a hit, as it is painful to watch. I found the film to be very unfunny, and the lead child actor was really annoying and unfunny. The film tries too hat delivering effective gags, and it fails because the material just doesn't cut it. In terms of a good comedy, this film doesn't even come close as being a funny film. The cast make it a horrible film, and the directing is unfocused and sloppy, that's to be expected from a Dennis Dugan film. This is comedy at its lowest form. A tiresome, boring film that is just painful to watch, Problem Child is a misfire of a film, one that never should have been made in the first place. The script has its limitations, and it constantly shows on-screen. If you're looking for a funny film with this one, you'll be sadly disappointed. I despised everything about this film, and I thought it was bad from start to finish. The film didn't even have potential of being a good comedy. This is one of those films that just has nothing good going for it. You should definitely avoid it, and watch a funnier film than this. This one scraps the bottom of the barrel, and it's too flawed to work. Avoid it like the plague. Annoying and never funny, this has got to be one of the worst films in the genre.

Mr & Mrs. Healy find out they can't make their own children because Mrs. Healey can't have them so they decide to adopt and they pick the baddest of the litter. Junior goes and lives with the Healeys and at every which turn gets into trouble. This is a laugh-a-minute comedy that will having you laughing to the credits.

Flo is obsessed with pets more than people, but Ben has been waiting for a kid of his own. They decide to adopt a kid- but they have definetely chosen the wrong kid. Even the nuns don't want Jr. By just days, Ben and Flo are sick of Junior's wild pranks and antics and are considering sending him back to the orphanage, but will they consider another option (which is by far worse)?
I know pretty much everyone here hated this movie. Actually, pretty much everyone her hates all of the comedy movies I like. But actually, this isn't a movie that I liked so much. I have to give some credit to John Ritter, who I thought was good in this. The only people I didn't like: the extra annoying child and wife. Both are annoying as heck and I can't stand either of them. It was an ""eh"" movie, the kid wasn't funny and all of the jokes weren't half of the time. The best part of the movie was with Michael Richards (Seinfeld's Kramer) punching a clown. I truthfully don't suggest this movie, a bit too slapstick silly.

3,I seem to be the only one who likes this movie?,Problem Child
1,"""Problem Child"" is a pretty typical cheesy children's comedy from the 90's, with just enough dirt in it to give it edge.  On a scale of 1 to Home Alone in this genre, Problem Child only manages a 2.  Michael Oliver's voice is SO ANNOYING.  I know that the kid is supposed to be like Dennis the Menace but this kid was just way too annoying.  The film has its moments, like the party scene where  Leslie Gore's ""It's My Party"" is a perfect fit.  Also, Michael Richards makes a good comical villain.  ""Look, a giraffe!""  ""Look, a fist!"" [punch] - I remember rewinding that over and over again as a kid.  But the cheesiness of the ending is vomit-worthy and John Ritter's acting just did not do it for me.  The movie was amusing as a kid but as my movie pallet has matured, I have left the below-average children's comedies behind.",Problem Child

1,"Problem Child was definitely a problem movie. With gaudy acting and narration, this confusing, but somewhat funny, feature focuses majority on the discipline-free antics of the ""Problem Child"", adopted by a gaudy man and his plastic gaudy wife. The movie plays out as a slightly mature Disney movie, but sadly the content is anything but mature. 
   The real-killer in this movie is the time wasted on long-drawn out impossible feats that the ""problem child"" commits. But, of course, this just brings him closer to his father. And somehow, the kid wrote an actual criminal in his nun-run orphan home, and that snowball effects to the confusing and terrible ending.
   The movie was a major let-down, but a good thing for your bored 7-Year old to watch. The plot could have been much better, the acting could have been much better, and so could everything else. The movie may have little to offer, but is a classic Rotten movie.",Problem Child

Recently, I've written less reviews. Half a year ago, more or less, I wrote almost every day. One reason why I've become less effective is because of crappy movies like 'Problem Child'.

I watched this movie from the TV, and afterwards I asked myself ""Why didn't I change the channel? Did I want to hurt myself subconsciously?"" I still don't have the answer to these simple questions.

Say what you say of Gilbert Gottfried,  but I actually laughed to some of his scenes. There's something about his voice and manners that have a positive effect on me. John Ritter is lame as always but the real bastard of this movie is the child actor, Michael Oliver. I'm totally against hitting children but everytime I saw his face... Fuck me sideways! Have I ever seen a more annoying or less talented child actor? No.

This film came out the same year as Home Alone, but that film executed them much better. Michae Richards is also here in a pre-Kramer Seinfeld role and is great.

3,"First off do not consider this a sequel, the only things it has in common with Saturday Night Fever is the main actor and characters name with his mother in it and a strut to the Bee Gees Staying Alive song at the end.
John Travolta has an impressive physique which in my opinion is better than the much admired Brad Pitt physique of Fight Club that many men aspire too.  His dance moves are impressive and although the plot is a bit thin it's certainly no worse than Grease or Dirty Dancing in that respect.
Talking of Dirty Dancing there is a lot more going on here some of the time which is good as 2 people dancing was tedious, in Staying Alive there are dancers wearing dodgy open power ranger suits moving to some heavy Flash Gordon style music.  John looks like he's a mini Barbarian fighting Mings minions while dancing with a woman in red who is supposed to be the Devil.  The show the film revolves around makes no sense but according to theatre goers is the norm.
In Saturday Night Fever the main character Anthony was pretty cool all the way round where in this film he's more of an uncomfortable douche bag like Danny Zuko in Grease.  Most of the dance scenes are more like watching Fame and when you look at films like that this at least has a better story and main character from what I can remember.  Can anyone name even one character from Fame?
It's a shame this wasn't an 18 rated film as I'd like to have seen Jackie (Anthony's sort of girlfriend) or someone take a bat to Laura who just irritated me the whole way through.
To round up I see this film as Fame meets Dirty Dancing, meets Grease. meets Flash Gordon with a hint of Saturday Night Fever thrown in to sell cinema tickets.
John Travolta was Patrick Swayze before Patrick Swayze and Brad Pitt before Brad Pitt.  In the 80's nobody appreciated an attainable jacked physique, that didn't become a thing until after Fight Club so I can't help feeling John Travolta never quite got the props he deserved.",Staying Alive
4,"Cynthia Rhodes is gorgeous and vulnerable and her dancing is SPECTACULAR, not to mention she should have been a bigger recording artist; Satan's Alley is definitely a well-staged extravaganza, Far from Over, Finding out the hard way, and especially Never gonna give you up should have all been bigger hits and better recognized during awards season, even the Bee Gees Loving you too much and Someone belonging to Someone should be on heavy rotation on light classic FM no different than all the Saturday Night Fever hits of theirs that play on classic radio. Finola Hughes is bitchy, spoiled, entitled and campy greatness from the future Daytime Emmy winner. The movie does hurt from Tony Manero being such an unlikeable character here and the aggrandizing of his ego and his disregard and lack of respect for Rhodes' character truly bring the movie down, but the movie is brisk and short and the music is great mid 80's club and dance material. The movie is undeserving of its 0% Rotten Tomatoes.",Staying Alive
0,"Staying Alive is one of the biggest disappointments in movie history. This film lacks any charm and charisma that Saturday Night Fever had that made that film likeable. Saturday Night Fever had grittiness and realism while Staying Alive did not. The film was polluted by trash writing, forgettable musical numbers, and shockingly disappointing acting from John Travolta and Finola Hughes. Only one thing good came out of Staying Alive and that was when John Travolta struts across Times Square while the popular Bee Gees song ""Stayin' Alive"" plays.",Staying Alive

4,"I find the critical reviews interesting in the fact that they are just as generic as they are accusing this film of being - projection much? As for the film itself, it's the sequel to SNF, which is like the challenge of all challenges. Yes there are other directions it could have gone, but ironically I thought the focus was smaller, which is the opposite of the complaints. This was a mature look at relationships and interactions between adults and had a lot more substance than the naysayers suggest. Sure there was a lot of dancing and music - duh, it's a musical people! If nothing else, I always find this film a very good view of what life was like during a healthier time, when men and women actually interacted as free adults, as opposed to today's dystopian existence where everyone is a non-gendered automaton. And icing on the cake is very sexy, good looking people doing some excellent dancing to a pretty hot Broadway show.",Staying Alive

3,"It is not at par with Saturday Night Fever, and it definitely has a different tone, especially with all the vanity involved, but, Cynthia Rhodes is GORGEOUS in it and her songs and singing are touching and lovely. Her smile alone makes the movie sunny and airy, not to mention her fantastic dancing. There are far worse ways to spend two hours. Cynthia alone makes the movie totally worthwhile, so do the few moments when the movie gets into direct Saturday Night Fever territory. 

It is fun also to spot Patrick Swayze in an early terpsichorean role and to think later on they would both star in Dirty Dancing.

It was a dream come true to have met Cynthia at Barbra Streisand's concert in Chicago back in October of 2012 with then-husband Richard Marx, I was able to see in person what a gorgeous woman she is and to let her know how much I adore her performance in this movie.",Staying Alive

This is a different film. 
Tony is a man on the cusp of failing. He is so desperate to grasp for his dreams he's willing to surrender the things which are the foundation of his personality. Thankfully he recognizes the issue, and rectifies it.
It's possible that this film actually requires a zeitgeist where Dancing With the Stars/Strictly Ballroom exists as it relies heavily on clues within the may dance routines to develop the characters and their motivations.
Seeing John Travolta's stiff and constrained gyrations develop into (still somewhat stiff) free interpretation of the material is as eloquent an explanation of the characters journey as that portrayed through set-pieces which try to find a balance between acceptable and stilted.",Staying Alive

It has been eviscerated as a sequel which is fair enough but as a film this is not the worst film ever and Travolta's performance carries quite a lot of charm.

The script is horrible, empty characters, Travolta is not Tony in this movie, he is just Travolta with badass faces and muscles, his character uses the females in a kinda sexist way... But yeah he dances like a beast. Its a very safe movie, with a dumb script, the directing from Stallone is ok for the ""drama"" but on the dance scenes he is fresh and dinamic with effective camera movements and sucking good performances, creating harmony with the production design and the photography. The biggest problem is the choices, the pop rock style of the OST is kinda misplaced and cringy with the dance, its completely diferent from SNF style and not in a good way, the sexy rock ballet doesnt work with the original concept. A great disapoitment, with some very nice visuals to enjoy, but dead concept, dead script, dead fever.

The risk didn't pay off, but hey gotta give this guy credit for trying.   Travolta is giving it his all, during a time when he wasn't such the house hold name he once was.

And the importance of family with the role of his mother- and seeing her redemption from the her tragic loss of believing her kids were all failures from the first movie.  Also, the ability to want to see the tough luck kid overcome and succeed. I can see why Stallone took the part forward. What the movie really lacks is a strong score! The songs in retrospect are horrible and do nothing to carry the movie emotion forward. I would love to see this movie re done with a better score. Also, we need a completion of the story line! There needs to be a third movie to complete the trilogy.",Staying Alive

Tony Manero and a fellow dancer are best friends and an -and-off again couple.  They try out for a show together and Tony pursues a key crush and main character in the show.  Tony and his best friend get minor parts in the show and Tony gets a date with the girl where they have sex, but then she wants no part of him.  Tony has resentment to the girl and his best friend quickly becomes irritated.

Sylvester Stallone, director of Rocky II-IV, Rocky Balboa, Paradise Ally, and The Expendables, delivers Staying Alive.  The storyline for this was entertaining and very fun to watch unfold.  Some scenes seemed unrealistic, but others were fun.  The conclusion could have been better.  I enjoyed the acting and the cast includes John Travolta, Cynthia Rhodes, Finola Hughes, and Joyce Hyser.

""You know what I want to do?""
""What?""
""Strut.""

I have been ashamed I haven't seen this for some time so I was excited to find this on Netflix.  This was a fun film and is definitely dated (which is what makes this film work).  Overall, this is a cheesy fun film that is worth a viewing and has some nostalgic magic like Dirty Dancing.

I think he's fine here. if think if you accept the concept of the film, it's not so bad. sure, I would have preferred if this was rated R and grittier like the original.

3,"*GUILTY PLEASURE KLAXON* 
Sylvester Stallone writes, produces, directs and cameos in a rather out there sequel to Saturday Night Fever.
Tony Manero was a somebody in 70s Brooklyn. Now living in Manhattan, he is a wannabe Broadway dancer and actual part time dance class instructor/waiter. 
He meets a snooty dancer who is playing the lead in a show his girlfriend dances in and scores a part in her next show. A love triangle develops as Tony struggles with his own identity and shortcomings. Yada yada yada.
How Tony Manero has gone from discotheque king to Broadway is anyone's guess, but you have to leave the last film at the door. What we have here is a high camp masterpiece complete with Frank Stallone music (and a bit part) and Bob Mackie costuming. It's mostly a showcase for Travolta's ass and lunchbox which are beautifully framed in a series of tight trousers. 
An absurd film, but up there in the ""so bad it's good"" pantheon.",Staying Alive
3,"If you had 1000 pounds of melted Velveeta, you still wouldn't come
close to equaling the cheese factor contained in this movie. Yeah it's
entertaining but entertaining in the most horrific way possible. It's
so different from Saturday Night Fever that it doesn't even feel like a
sequel. It's its own movie and director Sly Stallone for what its worth, probably didn't even watch the original. I could be wrong though. 

As for Travolta in the lead, he's not horrible but now his Tony Manero
is a nutrition and fitness freak. In the 70's he smoked, drank, and
cussed. Now as a Broadway dancer in Staying Alive, he's mister goodie
two shoes and his character isn't half as angst ridden or edgy. He's
just not as cool this time around. 

Now as I mentioned earlier, this movie is sort of entertaining. With
the focus on things pertaining more to a love triangle than actual
dancing, there's something there that might actually be compulsively
watchable. The script is filled with tacky, macho, substance free
dialogue but eventually you'll surrender to the flick's effervescence
of campy goodness. Bottom line: Staying Alive is so campy, you might
have to pitch a tent.",Staying Alive

I especially loved Laura.

0,Sometimes sequels should not be made. This movie is a prim example of that...,Staying Alive
1,"Despite being notoriously critically panned, a sequel to Saturday Night Fever (1977) directed by Sylvester Stallone sounded like an 80's-themed guilty pleasure on one level or another.

Saturday Night Fever is arguably a classic, and there is a rare occasion where a classic needs a sequel. In the six years that have passed since Saturday Night Fever, the decades have changed. The former disco craze popularized by Saturday Night Fever that existed in the 1970's has long since peaked, experiencing a backlash from rock music fans as well as the notorious Disco Demolition Night of 1979. In essence, the disco glory days are long behind the year of 1983 and so the film must instead adhere to something more appropriate to the time. This hardly makes sense because the disco music and dance of Saturday Night Fever is what made it so iconic and a sequel which completely removes that notion would seem pointless from the get go. It takes little time before anyone not already aware of this notion will realize it while watching the actual film. 
The intro scene kicks Staying Alive off with an ""inspirational"" 80's montage, a theme director Sylvester Stallone is all too familiar with. While Frank Stallone's ""Far From Over"" kicks the film off with life, the things actually being depicted are an endless barrage of confusing dance moves including a lot of necks which seem to violently circulate in an attempt to pop off the heads of the humans they sit atop of, as well as some epileptic arm movements. The immediate realization I got from seeing all this is that Staying Alive's predominant focus is to take the legacy established by its predecessor and soil it with an attempt to be more like 1983's critically panned Flashdance than its actual predecessor. Much of the drama in the film is routine material which has already been covered once before and doesn't need to be repeated, though it spends the majority of the film playing second-fiddle to its obsession with dance sequences.
In Saturday Night fever, the material holding the film up outside of its dancing sequences were the cultural relevance of its setting, the multiple interesting characters and the genuine edge of gritty material. With Staying Alive, the film plays it way too safe and puts the burden essentially all on the shoulders of John Travolta and a collection of supporting players. If the cast is not wandering through the scenery at a slow pace and pondering the meaning of existence, they are performing some really strange dance sequences. Like I said before, it is a lot of awkward arm and head movements which Sylvester Stallone considers to be intelligent dance moves. They may edit into a montage nicely with Frank Stallone music, but there is no inspiration in the. And rather than capturing the dance scenes as the spectacle needed to actually support the film as some kind of a guilty pleasure, Staying Alive has its dance numbers shot as if they were part of a music video. It's enough that the dance scenes are already so strangely choreographed, but they are filmed no better even though they are the most entertaining scenes in the film. But it's clear as far back as the beginning that they are already burdened by a visual style which plagues Staying Alive throughout every moment. 
The entire film has a rather murky visual style. Almost surreal with its darkness, Staying Alive is so lacking in sensible lighting that there is constantly a sense of shadow overtaking everything, leaving the colour palette rather monochromatic. As well as that, anything which is not extremely close to the camera ends up blurred into the background as if camouflaged with the colours around them. Elements of the soundtrack may have appeal such as Frank Stallone's Golden Globe-nominated song ""Far From Over"" which is a piece so rich with 80's groove that it perfectly captures the tone Sylvester Stallone is going for, but Staying Alive is hardly a treat on the eyes or the mind despite a soundtrack with some decent songs.
As a result of all this, the cast are left stranded in one-dimensional roles and perform as such.
Returning to his Academy Award nominated role of Tony Manero, John Travolta offers little innovation to the role. While his muscular stature is impressive and his ability to dance with raw passion captures the hot-blooded spirit of the iconic character, the material offers him no new challenges. He simply brings back some of the dying spirit that gave him charm in Saturday Night Fever and milks them for what he can in Staying Alive, though it is hardly enough to breathe any real life into material this lacklustre. John Travolta's handsome appeal may reach die-hard fans, but he has nothing new to offer in the acting department.
Finola Hughes is not a brilliant newcomer. Though she keeps her energy active during the awkward dance scenes, there is nothing of value to her character and little iconic outside of her English accent amongst a crowd of generic American voices. She has little distinctive about her, and her attempts to bring the melodrama to life come off simply as an odd mix of pompous and pretentious with no positive results on the film's dramatic credibility, if there is any in the first place. Finola Hughes brings nothing memorable to Staying Alive and fails to inspire any kind of sparks with John Travolta.
Cynthia Rhodes ends up with some of the most tediously sentimental material in the film. And though she has a genuine feeling of humanity about her as well as an energetic physical spirit, she cannot transcend the heavy weight laid down on her by the poor script.

So though Staying Alive offers a distinctively 80's feeling thanks in part to the music of Frank Stallone, it is burdened by a story which goes nowhere but in in circles of decade-related cliches while abandoning the disco glory of the 1970's for a series of senseless dance sequences.",Staying Alive
5,"I Love this movie! Its my fav, John Travolta fan & really liked the dancing.",Staying Alive
0,"How do you follow up a movie like Saturday Night Fever which captured the spirit of an era so perfectly? I don't know and niether did the people who made Staying Alive.

Staying Alive takes place five years after Saturday Night Fever and follows Tony Monero as he attempts to make it big on Broadway. Usually the opening credits won't give you any indication of the movie quality, except this was one of those rare cases where it did. In the first four mintues we see dancing in a very bland manner with music that has little to no style setting the very low bar for the rest of movie. Now what completely caught me by suprise was that Sylvester Stallone was one of the writers, then it said he was one of the producers, and finally it ended it's opening credits with ""Directed by Sylvester Stallone"". Of course this make sense because you when think about people dancing in leotard you think of Slyvester Stallone who's well know for his dancing flick such as..... Shall We Dance Rambo and Rocky Dirty Dancing. This is the just begining of many reasons why this sequel completely fails in bringing anything new to the legacy of it predecessor.

In Stallone defense he did refrain from originally having an angry John Travolta mowing down dancers with a machine-gun Rambo style, though that would have been allot better than how Staying Alive unlimately turned out. Stayling Alive simply has none of the charm nor the fun of Saturday Night Fever.  So how do you update the image Toney Manero who last time we saw him was smoking, drinking, and cursing all the time accompanied by a harsh and gritty plot? Simple, you take away all of the characteristics that caused him life issues and replace the gritty story with filler, I mean bland romance. The movie plot consists of a series of filler for 80s pops used to artically create it mood and dancing sequences proving the writers weak point are dialouge sequences. Which is why you'll get montages devolping characters instead of coherent dialouge making every scene feels unfinished creating a disjointed feel that prevents the viewer from becoming fully immersed in the narrative. 

The lack of chimstry between actors doesn't help either unless you're going for no drama, lack of effort, and aimlessly going from scenes to scenes which they do perfectly. Aisde from Travolta every single one of the actors lack passion and a comminment to put the slightest emotion in their expressions. Not everything here is completely trash, there are some good lines but nothing good enough to make sitting through this worth it. The only thing maringally worthwhile is the music which does all the work to tell the story, but even that's not enough to even bother looking for the sequel and listening to ""Staying Alive"" by The Bee Gees is provided me more entertainment than the movie ever did. Once I saw the ending credit rolls and I saw from what I like assume Travolta character walking back in time to Saturday Night Fever, I knew deep down the movie wasted my time and will no doubt be a quick forgettable affair.

Staying Alive is a inessentail, completely pointless followup that we could have done without. It offers nothing new to the exsisting material and takes away everything that made it predecessor worth watching. Someone should have pulled the plug and prevented this sequel from Staying Alive.",Staying Alive

2,"The sequel to Saturday Night Fever (1977), and producer Robert Stigwood, decided to get Sylvester Stallone, (then hot off First Blood and Rocky III) to writer, co-produce and direct it. It's that fact that stays in your mind throughout the film, and it makes for an odd combination, and it hangs over the film like a big, pink, glittery cloud. There's nothing in this film you can take seriously. Former disco king Tony Manero (John Travolta) is now living in Manhattan, living a clean life and trying to make it big on Broadway as a dancer, but he finds it hard to get past the audition stages. To make ends meet he works as a dance teacher and a waiter at a dance club, but things change when he meets English dancer Laura (Finola Hughes), who he spends the night with, even though Tony has an on-off relationship with Jackie (Cynthia Rhodes), the singer in a local band. Tony, along with Laura and Jackie, audition for a new Broadway production called 'Satan's Alley', directed by Jesse (Steve Inwood), it's a performance that pushes Tony to the limit, but he has to choose between Laura and Jackie ultimately. This has all the makings of a guilty pleasure, but there are parts of it which drag. It comes across as a non-pornographic version of Showgirls, and Travolta dances, prances and mugs as much as Nomi Malone did in that.  It's a daring film for Sly, but it's a bit off-kilter, plus it ends on a shot of Travolta's bum, what does that tell you??",Staying Alive

4,Why do I love this movie so much?,Staying Alive
3,"Yes! The music in this film is uniformly awful! I will agree. (Except for ""Stayin' Alive"", which is always fun.) And some of the dancing is questionable.

However, I disagree with most of the reviewers who claim that this movie was pointless, horribly written, badly acted, etc. It was none of those. Actually it was very true to the spirit of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the character of Tony Manero in particular. In ""Saturday"" Tony met a mature woman and started to grow up. In this film he continues to grow, gets slapped around by life a little, and even falls in love.

I saw this movie in the theater when it was released and found it electrifying. I just watched it again this evening and much of the excitement I had at the first viewing is still there. Travolta is as magnetic as ever, Cynthia Rhodes is lovely and beautiful, and I was absolutely mesmerized by the bewitching Finola Hughes and could absolutely understand (in 1983 and today) why Tony Manero could risk the love of his life for even one night with her.

Also: the movie captures the spirit of the theater in ways that few movies can. It shows the hard work, sweat, and the incredibly beautiful bodies and faces of the stage.",Staying Alive

Plot is thin, but the behind-the-scenes look at a Broadway dance show is interesting.  Far too much time is spent on the actual show though, making you think that the whole movie may as well have been one big recording of a dance show.

Music is kind of cheesy, specially the music in the Broadway production.

Acting is so-so.  Cynthia Rhodes gives probably the only convincing performance.  John Travolta is his usual one-dimensional self and Finola Hughes is irritating.",Staying Alive

5,Great movie from the good old days.,Staying Alive
2,poor sequel to a fab original,Staying Alive
2,Tony Manero loses the plot,Staying Alive
2,"Saturday Night Fever is more of a time capsule than a movie.  The characters don't so much tell a story as they simply exist in it. It so perfectly captured late 1970's America, that it had once been the 12th highest grossing movie of all time.

The filmmakers here must have never seen the original. Everything that made Fever what is was is gone here. Sure John Travolta returns, but he's bears no resemblence to the Tony Manero of the previous film. Not in attitude, and certainly not physically. One a pencil thin, polyester wearing street punk, he's been tranformed into ripped abs, loincloth wearing Tarzan who leaps around the stage in hopes of becoming a Broadway dancer.

Should the blame be placed on writer/director Sylvester Stallone? That's right...Stallone. No. In fact, the blame should be placed on Travolta. As history tells it, after seeing Rocky III, Travolta demanded the studio pursue Sly to helm the sequel to what was then, his biggest box office hit. Without Travolta, there would be no sequel. The studio agreed, made Stallone the offer...and there you are.

Staying Alive is typical of the 80's sequel. All style, no substance. The ""story"" exists only to string together several flashy, fog filled dance sequence pieced together with 80's power rock music, to create not scenes, but videos that ran endlessly on MTV. I've never seen a Broadway show, but if this is what is typical of them, I'll stick to movies.

Yet for all that, it's strangely watchable. It's like a car crash that you simply can't turn away from. Travolta tries. He flashes his million dollar smile and once in a while shows a brief flash of the things that made him a star with Fever. The two leading ladies are also fine in their limited, and stereotypical roles. Cynthia Rhodes is the long suffering girlfriend with a heart of gold, and Finola Hughes is that star dancer with a heart of ice. A love triangle ensues, but do you need a slide rule to figure out how it's going to end?

Stallone does direct with energy. As co-writer, he must've known how weak the script was, and never lets the audience go too long without another high powered dance number. It may be weak, but it's never boring.

The other thing that most seperates this from the original is the music. The soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever is one of the biggest selling albums of all time. Producing four number one hits, and going platinum 15 times over, it was as much a phenomenon as the movie, and made The Bee Gees the biggest band in the world. This movie has songs by....Frank Stallone. Oh sure the The Bee Gees throw one or two new songs in there, but this soundtrack is all about nepetism, and the slightly more clearly talking Stallone brother gets his 15 minutes.

Is it the worst sequel ever made? Despite what many critics think, no it isn't. However this is the last movie in the world for anyone who ranks Saturday Night Fever as one of their favorite movies. For everyone else, it's a harmless way to kill 2 hours on a Sunday afternoon if there's nothing else on tv but golf. Hey...that's what I did.",Staying Alive

2,"Not sure how Sylvester Stallone came to write and direct a sequel to Saturday Night Fever but, if they were hoping to bring a Rocky-like vibe to Tony Manero's quest to become a Broadway dancer, they were sadly mistaken. Stallone matches the style of Night, but, none of it's raw energy or flavor. He also fails to bring any of the excitement or drama of his own Rocky films to the table and instead we have a watered down and dull sequel that focuses on Manero's attempts to woo two woman at once and leaves his quest for stardom in the background. Add to that the insult of the new Bee Gees tunes taking a backseat to songs by Sly's brother, Frank Stallone and you have a very disappointing follow up to an American classic. It's almost as if Stallone hadn't even seen the film he was making a sequel to.",Staying Alive

3,"Overall not a bad movie, in my opinion. 
I think that one of the reasons why it didn't work too well is because it was meant to be the sequel to Saturday Night Fever -- very hard to make a sequel after the HUGE success of the preview movie; though, personally, big part of the success of Saturday Night Fever came from the soundtrack.
Except from the character Tony Manero, and the dancing, I don't see any relation between the two movies.
Like I said, not a bad movie overall, I enjoy watching it every now and then. And because of its soundtrack and the modern dance of that period, Staying Alive kind of goes hand in hand with Flashdance more than with Saturday Night Fever.",Staying Alive
2,"Some of this was well-acted, some of it was boring, and some of it was ridiculously campy. Obviously the campy stuff was the best.",Staying Alive
1,"Everyone who thought it was just a waste of time was wrong. There was a lesson to be learned from ""Grease 2"". Most movies that become a part of popular culture are a one-time phenomenon. Movies like the original ""Grease"" are rare occasions where the perfect casting and music come together and captivate a generation. Lightning never strikes twice, which brings me to ""Staying Alive"". This is a campy, silly and totally unnecessary sequel to ""Saturday Night Fever"" that fails miserably to recapture the magic of the earlier film. John Travolta's Tony Mannero isn't the same likeable guy he was back in 1978. This time out he's a jealous womanizer who gets so excited about finally nailing a new chick that he has to call his girlfriend. Travolta just looks ridiculous, and this much maligned picture was the start of his first fall from grace in the 80's.
The Bee-Gee's try to salvage it with their music, but there are no hits here. In fact, it's sad to say that the best song in the movie is from director Sylvester Stallone's less talented brother Frank. His ""Far From Over"" is a classic guilty pleasure. And then there's ""Satan's Alley"", the musical number that concludes this mess. It's still setting records in Hell as the longest running production there.
This disaster is not without entertainment value, but you won't be laughing with it.",Staying Alive
0,"This is a terrible movie. It's a sequel to Saturday Night Fever, but has absolutely nothing that made that movie worthwhile: no plot, no character development, no sense of gritty reality, nothing really. Even the Beegees soundtrack for this one is much worse than the one for the original. All this movie has is a bunch of tacky, ridiculous dance numbers stuck between clich√É (C) scenes involving really only three characters, none of whom are interesting or change at all. John Travolta seems to be trying in this movie, but his character has had all the life and humanity sucked right out of him. It all culminates in an absurd Broadway musical that seems to have been directed by David Lynch, filmed in constant slow-motion. It's funny that it was directed by Sylvester Stallone, known for manly movies such as Rocky and Rambo and The Expendables, because in addition to being awful it's one of the gayest things I've ever seen. Only worth watching to make fun of.",Staying Alive

1,"Was a sequel necessary for 'Saturday Night Fever'? I think not. Hard to believe that Stallone co-wrote and directed this sequel, even giving himself a quick cameo (bumping into Manero on the sidewalk early in the film). They even explain the PG rating when Manero explains he cleaned up his act - no drinking, smoking, or cursing (which his character exhibited greatly in the predecessor to this film). Its hard to compare the dances in each one for they are shot differently, not to mention two different styles as well. The last few minutes of this film was a poor attempt at making a connection to the opening of 'Saturday Night Fever.'",Staying Alive

The story finds Tony Manero (Travolta) six years later working as a waiter in a nightclub while he tries to realize his dreams of dancing on Broadway (what tough street kid from Brooklyn doesn't?) He eventually makes the cut as an extra for ""Satan's Alley"" (billed as ""a musical trip through Hell"") and immediately sets his sights on the show's snooty prima-donna star (Finola Hughes, decidedly unsuited for such dancing as her role requires). Meanwhile, the nice girl he's been seeing (Cynthia Rhodes) stands by her man, waiting patiently for him to come around. When the male lead can't cut it, Tony is offered the part, and tensions rise. The action culminates in the show itself and Tony's ultimate realization that he needs to please only himself. Indeed, the horrific dancing combined with Frank Stallone's inane musical score makes one wonder just how accurate the show's billing of ""a musical trip through Hell"" actually is. As long as one disassociates this film from its predecessor, Staying Alive is highly enjoyable for its schlock value; it may well be an inadvertent camp classic for Travolta's sweaty thongs alone.

I think what most people didn't like about the film was its generally lacklustre acting and poor script but that being said it does have an interesting mystery and sports some beautiful camera work in a few scenes and generally a very good plot. The film is not a horror film in my opinion, almost everyone's biggest problem with the film was what made it stand out to me, which was that there weren't any real scares and the antagonist is underdeveloped and has no horror climax, when in fact the whole premise of the film is about a woman who clearly has psychotic depression and the entire film is set from the perspective of her mind warped by grief. It's not difficult to pick it out relatively early in the film but a movie about the mind of a woman suffering from psychosis I found was very riveting with lots of great commentary about mental illness. Watch absolutely any scene in the film which alludes to horror and you can see the effort the filmmakers put in to skew the perception of the events unfolding as a part of an ultimately well rounded narrative.",The Disappointments Room

This is one of those movies that can't decide whether it wants to actually be a ghost story or instead a look into the mind of a mentally unstable woman. Since she's the only one who can see the ghosts, it all might be in her head. This really undermines any tension that was trying to be built as well as taking any possible scares right out of the movie. The story is not that interesting to begin with, then you get the wishy-washy ghost story/mentally deranged tangle and  you wind up with a movie that is lousy but has a great looking lead buried underneath the hair that forever hangs in her face and the clothes that cover everything.

Shot in the style of some 4th year film student with a clunky indie feel, except the student never actually learned what makes a film work and only seems to follow that studious formulaic process in hopes of pretentiously impressing the teacher for a grade.  It's like a comedian that boils every joke down to the base elements via a scientific process, like South Park's Funnybot, without actually knowing what's funny.

Too many times does it sabotage itself by showing too much of the supernatural stuff to be taken at face value, thereby ruining the audience's suspension of disbelief.  87% of the film shows what *could* be happening if the film decided to continue in a certain direction down the rails of the plot, only to derail the train, sweep it all up, and replant it on the track five minutes back.  Instead of a slick plot device hoping to confuse the audience and have them relate to the protagonist's mental health issues it falls completely flat and executes in a manner that leaves you feeling like the director didn't know which direction to take in the end and just left a big wad of mashed together nonsense in for the final cut.

Save your time and money.  I watched it on Netflix and I STILL want my money back.",The Disappointments Room
1,"Sometimes there's films that, really, I don't even know how to begin their review.  It doesn't really connect to any point I want to make prior to the actual review itself nor do they really do anything outstanding that it makes reviewing them easy.  Let's just get this out of the way, there's absolutely nothing that this movie does well.  Absolutely nothing.  I suppose you could say that Kate Beckinsale, despite having a poorly developed character, gives a solid performance.  And that's certainly a very valid point, but Kate Beckinsale's performance exists outside of everything else that happens in the film.  Kate is solid in spite of everything else that is happening around her.  I get the film's concept and its inspiration in trying to tell this story.  Kate is a mother whose baby died, in an accident, the year prior to the film's events.  Dana (Beckinsale's character) is overcome with grief, understandably.  The family then decides to move away from the hustle and bustle of the city to a more isolated house in the country so Dana, hopefully, can move on from the accident and get her life back on track.  Dana, who's also an architect, decides to renovate the house as having a project might help her deal with her issues.  Dana, while exploring her house, finds this room up in the attic that isn't in any of the blueprints and has a chifforobe in front of the entrance.  The door, also, only locks from the outside.  Dana has some strange experiences in this room, like being locked inside it and believing that she was trapped in there for hours.  She tries to find out the history behind this room and is told that this room, called a disappointments room creatively enough, were built for children with special needs or deformities to be confined to.  They would put this children in this room to keep them from embarrassing the rest of the family.  Conceptually speaking, the film is somewhat intriguing.  Like just from a basic point of view.  If you were to tell me the basic idea of finding out what happened in this 'disappointment room' in the past and the dark story behind this room, then I would have though that that was a decent concept.  It's not a great concept, and it's not really that different from other films that have explored similar subjects in places like insane asylums, but it could have been decent.  Sadly, however, the film just wastes the idea.  Firstly, this isn't really a horror movie.  I'd complain about jump scares, but the fact is that there aren't any.  There's a few scenes where you see figures walking in front of the camera, but I wouldn't call those scares.  I would call that the set-up.  Yet the scares never actually came.  I get the idea behind focusing so much of the film on Dana's emotional and mental issues.  It calls into question everything she says, even though she's telling the truth.  But the film's insistence on focusing on that really leaves no room to develop an actually scary story about a father, whose shame of his daughter was so great, that he actually killed her with a hammer to the face.  I think the film should have juxtaposed that with Dana's own issues, she feels like she's a terrible mother.  And, maybe, the film was meant to juxtapose those two elements but, if they were, they did an awful job of it.  They really fucking did.  Characters are introduced to set up potential subplots that aren't actually ever paid off on.  The acting is fine, but it doesn't really matter when the script they're servicing is so much of nothing.  The narrative escalates to a point where Dana literally loses her shit at this dinner party, that just so happens to take place the same day that her daughter (the one who died) was born.  She destroys everything around her, all the plates, vases, glasses, etc.  A few minutes later, she goes into her son's room and she sees the father (the one who murdered his daughter) standing over her son's bed.  She proceeds to take a hammer to this guy's face.  When Dana's husband comes in, all he sees is Dana hammering a pillow right next to her son's body.  The kid is obviously distraught.  But David, the kid's father, manages to convince him that it was just a nightmare (this kid must be some sort of moron).  Dana and David then have a conversation about what she's feeling and then they just leave the house.  And that's how the movie ends.  Really.  Oh, of course, there's the typical 'it's not really over' bullshit.  But, since they've already left the house, it's not like it matters.  Talk about an anticlimactic ending.  All that ""story"" for, literally, an ending that gives you next to no satisfaction.  It felt flat like a motherfucker.  So, yea, this movie was kind of bad.  It's not really a horror movie, it lacks a plot that makes use of the various elements that are at play here, it doesn't really build to anything and the ending is completely anticlimactic.  The acting may be decent, but there's no real reason to care about any of the characters.  If it wasn't obvious, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this movie.  There's certainly worse films out there (like Sammo Hung's The Bodyguard, which I reviewed a few days ago), but this one just won't do anything for most of you.  And for those of you that do find something to like here, please tell me who your weed supplier is.",The Disappointments Room

1,"The Disappointments Room is a disappointment itself. A little interesting plot fully ruined by its lame execution, where, it seems that the actors' efforts we're put into trash.

I personally don't think that the problems entirely lies on its director, D.J. Caruso, where he's proven that he's also good at some action-thriller flicks like Eagle Eye (2008) and xXx: Return Of Xander Cage (2016 / 2017). The biggest chunk of failure in this movie is the limited budget paired with an ambitious story, a tale that could've been deeper with a more frightening house, like a gothic-type-mansion-like and a more believable threat.

Kate Beckinsale, as we all know, is a well established actress, her skills are unquestionable and we are complacent on how the other actors performed as well, but what we can all see are wasted efforts all around.

2,"My boyfriend and I were having a bad day at school, so we decided to go watch ""The Disappointments Room"" just to make ourselves feel better. The good news is we did, the bad news is we felt good for the wrong reasons.

My boyfriend and I came to this movie expecting to get the living daylights scared right out of us. We left the theater eating a bag of nachos thinking of stupid nickname puns we could use to describe this movie. 

First of all, don't worry guys the movie lives up to its title, so if you've been wanting to be disappointed  for a while now. This movie is for you and I wholeheartedly recommend you should watch it.

This movie is filled with loose ends and so many horror cliches that I was actually beginning to wonder if something suspenseful was going to happen anytime soon. So many mysteries are left unsolved and the only one who's experiencing any of this is our main female lead who's mentally unstable. 

The movie has a bad habit of trying to build suspenseful moments at the wrong moments and the wrong times.  The most scariest part of the movie for me was when she was locked into a dark room for 20 minutes only to be disappointed when I realized nothing was happening. The only thing my boyfriend felt scared about were the dusty windows, and that's only because he works as a window washer.

The cinematography was so poorly done in this movie that I was wondering as to whether or not this was done by a group of high school students or a team of professionals. 

All in all, a poorly done movie that doesn't deserved to be labeled a horror, mystery, and suspense, but is more than deserving of its name. 

Do yourself a favor and don't spend your $15 on this movie.",The Disappointments Room

2,"You may not recognize the name D.J. Caruso, but if you're under the age of thirty-five you've probably seen a few of his movies. Whether it be the 2004 Angelina Jolie mystery/thriller Taking Lives, the double feature he directed with Shia LaBeouf in 2007 and 2008 with Disturbia and Eagle Eye or even the sign his career wasn't headed in as promising a direction as we'd hoped with 2011's I Am Number Four adaptation. The thing is, I want to like Mr. Caruso as I hold a special place in my heart for Disturbia which was more or less a modernization of Hitchcock's Rear Window (which itself was based on Cornell Woolrich's short story 'It Had to Be Murder'), but done with the added elements of humor and teen drama to make it more appealing to a broader audience. That Caruso was able to take the tense and rather static story from which Rear Window came and infuse it with a sly charm while keeping the inherent tensions intact was a feat worth acknowledging, but in the near decade since Disturbia it seems the filmmaker has become more a director for hire rather than the auteur he seemed to show the promise of becoming. What happened to the director? Why is his next project a fifteen year later sequel to a Vin Diesel movie that was only greenlit in the first place because of the success of The Fast & the Furious? We may never know, but while The Disappointments Room might have been a much hyped spring/pre-summer release rather than a slight horror film hoping to be disposed of in the dumping grounds of September ten years ago (given both Caruso's clout as well as Beckinsale's at that time) that is unfortunately exactly what we have today. Worse, The Disappointments Room suffers at the fate of being the first film to be released since Relativity Studios filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection on July 30, 2015. And so, with a reported budget of $15 million Relativity and its Rogue label are simply hoping to make some kind of profit by releasing this as quick as they can before its sits too long on the shelf. Despite all of what it has going against it though, it is easier than one might expect to understand why Caruso, who penned the screenplay with Wentworth Miller (Prison Break), had a desire to tell this story; the real issue being they chose to tell this story within the confines of a stale genre template.

True, the mind can truly muster up it's own horrors and I believe this film captured that.  SO, it takes place in an old haunted house (critics always take the easy cliche's) I'm sure it was used purely as a metaphor for her mind.  As your troubles will follow you where ever you go (whether you are at a stately mansion or an ocean view. ) Kate was fantastic as well as the rest of the cast.  Loved the little boy.  I do think there are some important scenes that were edited out for whatever reason.  I'd love to see the director's original cut.  All in all, give this film a chance.

It's effective at developing the central couple, but it doesn't ever build any suspense and doesn't have any real scares to speak of.

0,"Before I begin, let me say this. At the moment the line ""I think you might have yourself a disappointments room!"" was uttered by a kooky old librarian, the theater (the 10 people that were in it) erupted with laughter. Let that be a testament to how bad the rest of this film was.

It seems to be a common joke to say the title of this movie aptly describes the audience in the theater, but by god, is there ever truth in comedy.

For a movie marketed as a ""psychological thriller"", this sure was a snooze-fest. it was 20 percent cliched ""ghost"" imagery, 20 percent people smoking, and 60 percent of a close-up of a cross-eyed woman's trembling lips as she looks at ""spooky"" stuff. There seriously isn't a whole lot else to say, because there really is NOTHING else.

There was nothing psychological about it either. It was all pretty typical ghost story shite.

The only entertaining part of the movie was the huge emotional meltdown at the dinner table. And by entertaining, I mean hilarious.

Lastly, the acting is some of the worst I've ever seen, and it starts as soon as the movie begins. That kid sounds like he's practically reading his lines off of  a teleprompter. Every character was over-the-top in a very cringeworthy way.

Oh my. Well, they really nailed the title down. This film is like the Dwarves of Moria digging so deep that they unleash a Balrog made of shit demons. 

Walking out of this film I have some thoughts... 

First, tha fuck did I just watch?!?!

Second, the people who wrote this have only seen a poorly dubbed and foreign language version of The Shining, possibly Taliban dubbed.... Or this is the Kim Jong Un version....... Or.... Out of extreme depression, the writer of this movie got terminally drunk while watching The Shining, then the It's Always Sunny episode when Sweet Dee had Glue sniffing overdose while sleeping over at Frank and Charlie's apartment came on and in his brain damaged, drunken stupor, he knocked out a terrible movie script. 

Holy train wreck Batman. It's like the manatees that carry the plot balls to write Family Guy, went horror then had a simultaneous stroke.... Followed by an alcohol and LSD fueled hypoxia binge.

Third, the editor was cooking meth made from the memory cards containing the good parts of this film. 

Fourth, casting one of the hottest, most ridiculously beautiful women to ever escape Great Britain, does not save you from making one of the worst films of this decade. My very favorite part of this movie is the moment where Kate Beckinsale realizes what an utter piece of shit this movie is going to be, gets piss drunk and trashes the set while wielding a chef's knife at quite possibly the single worst actor in the history of film that's not named Jake Lloyd. That wasn't method acting, it was Kate realizing that she'd made the single worst casting decision in her entire film career. 

Fifth, I predict THIS MOVIE will both win the Golden Raspberry Worst Picture award and it could very well be the greatest RiffTraxx movie ever made, possibly even better than The Room. Seriously, they need to make this. It'll kill.

Sixth, Simon.... From Simon and Simon, was cast to play the former caretaker from The Shining (The North Korea version). He had the greatest opportunity ever offered anyone in film to lick Kate Beckinsale's manic drunken eyeball.... And he failed me..... Goddamn you Gerald McRaney (Simon, from Simon and Simon), you failed to do this for me.

This movie pulls no punches in it's direct and callous misinterpretation of ALL of the horror genre. From the opening credits, it establishes that you literally want EVERY SINGLE CAST MEMBER to die in this story...... Except for Beckinsale.... Because she's very pretty. But literally EVERYONE else. 

Never, in a film, have side characters been more unimportant and.... just terrible....

There is a scene in this movie where a side character is doing this fuckawful southern accent and she completely and utterly bows the entire scene TWICE by forgetting her fuckawful dialogue. I laughed hysterically at this. It's like the editor just shat this movie into completion. 

*** There is ALSO a dinner scene precipitated by one of the most incomprehensible and completely random montages ever set to film. Followed by a story climax that must be the equivalent of being the lucky 57th appointment of the day to a Korean massage parlor run by one 62 year old chronic alcoholic, severely depressed, lady of the night... because if you saw her in daylight you'd think she'd been the victim of a tragic industrial accident.

Seriously, this movie is that fucking awful. 

My ONLY hope in the movie, halfway through, was that because of the R rating, we'd see a bit more of Kate Beckinsale (naked)..... Nope! Thankfully, she's better than that. 

This movie, by its own volition, has the distinct ability to make EVERY auditorium it plays in a Disappointment Room.",The Disappointments Room

At first it appears to be a haunted house vehicle. Then it seems to want to turn into a reality bending is-she-isn't-she crazy movie. Then it meanders on through a turn at being  a drama. 

About halfway in I finally realized what it was ... just bad.

Kate Beckinsale, who doesn't have the broadest range of acting chops to begin with, turns in a fairly embarassing performance. And the actor who plays her husband (Michael Landers) must have just graduated from the Woody Allen School of Method Acting because WOW was he in the wrong flick!

1,"Skid Tires On Pavement before thinking about taking any risks involving snacks, friends and Redline because in the end the snacks will be all on you. Fancy posters, awesome wheels and one gorgeous woman is all this film has in store and nothing else. The cast is so jumbled up that you have no idea who's who and why they're there in the first place. Eddie Griffin is one of a few names you know from other movies like Undercover Brother and Deuce Bigalow and he plays a drag racing gambler named Infamous. He's good for the humor and his rare moments of acting, nothing else. The girl at the center of all this mayhem is none other than Nadia Bjorlin, if you're a Soap Opera fan then you'll know her as Chloe Lane from Days of Our Lives. Andy Cheng doesn't bring a whole lot to the table besides the lineup of cars and some i do believe actually do get damaged. Again the characters will have you guessing on who's really running the show, the story starts off as a no caffeine version of Fast & The Furious but somehow becomes the very cheesy made for tv entertainment to give Nadia more screen time..

Redline doesn't even give you the satisfaction of enjoying the cars.  A bunch of fast forward (literally, they FF the race footage) and CG bulls*** makes the race scenes laughable.  Actually, I hesitate to even use the word laughable, because you don't want to laugh.  You sit there and wonder how someone could ever finance this POS film as happiness itself leaves your body.  This movie is so bad it's like a dementor from Harry Potter.  Over the course of an hour and a half, it will suck all the happiness from your soul and leave you wondering why you just spent $10+ to get kicked in the intellectual nuts.  In short, Eddie Griffin's Ferrari Enzo crash is a perfect metaphor for this ""movie.""  It's something cool given to a person who doesn't deserve it and has no idea WTF they are doing, and then you have to sit there and watch them slam it into a concrete barrier, while somehow convincing yourself that a benevolent God can still exist when a Ferrari Enzo is dead and Eddie Griffin is not.",Redline

0,"Possibly the WORST movie I have ever seen. The cars in this movie have more acting ability than the actors. Poor acting, writing, directing, editing, and narration make this ""film"" a hollywood abortion. Right toward the end of the film, you are thrown into the middle of a plotline, that previously was not in the movie.... I am not kidding. Totally random, poorly done, uncalled for fights occus about every 15 minutes. Eddi Griffin sucked too. If you want to look at nice cars and hot women, just surf the net rather than watch this movie.",Redline

2,"This is a movie for those, who are exotic cars fanatics. Weak script made this movie a disaster in the box-office. But good thing is, you can see some adrenaline pump drag races with cool Exotics like Ford GT, Lamborghini Diablo, Porsche Carrera GT, Mercedes Benz SLR Mclaren, Enzo Ferrari, Koenigsegg CCX and even more. The heroine Nadia Bjorlin surely was damn hot in the movie. If Fast & Furious focused on Tuners/Muscle Cars, Redline is all about exotic supercars.",Redline
0,"VROOM VROOM VROOM Hot girls, aspiring rapper, hero soldier, Natasha, her mother, kidnappings, luxury cars, hostage takings, nice video cover, okay title and that adds up to...a really bad film. Unfortunately, it is one of the funniest I have seen. Apparently, the film is taken place between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, but I am not sure if that is in the United States on the planet Earth. The story is contrived and proposterous that at times, I thought it could have been on another planet in another solar system, which also had cities of the same name. The singing, acting, and dialogue are awful and that's understatement. The editing is randomly sliced and cut up that the film just becomes a source of confusion. The special effects are so over-the-top and hilarious. One instance is a car that crashes at the end of a drag race, and it somehow crashes when it mysteriously goes from very fast to a 90 degree angle up in the air, doing inane cartwheels. Another scene is a motorcycle that passes over railroad crossing in the path of train. Amazingly, the motorcycle barely makes it, and it slowly goes through the air and the train (Metrolink to be exact and that is in Los Angeles, and at that point I thought they were still in Las Vegas) is going faster than the motorcycle. Literally, the film is so bad, it's laugable. I cried with tears of laughter throughout this disaster. It is almost worth seeing just for the few chuckles.",Redline

Sadly, this film is poorly executed. It may be likened to The Fast and the Furious series but it's nothing like those either. The story is probably too complicated for what it needed to be and the rest falls pretty flat. It's not a waste of time, but I think seeing it once is enough - although more of Nadia Bjorlin wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing!",Redline

2,"Okay, first of all: I love cars. I really do. The faster the better. And that basically was the only reason for me to watch this movie in the first place. And what can I say? It remained the ONLY reason to watch ""Redline"" for the cars and some of the race scenes are the only things worth paying attention to. Bad script, painfully bad acting, bad effects...but somewhat decent soundtrack. A very poor attempt to attract the ""The Fast and The Furious"" audience. 

So yeah, if you love hot, fast and exotic cars ""Redline"" is worth having a look at; just shut out all else in the movie. Just the cars and their sexy sounds and looks. If you're not into cars, it's gonna be a waste of time (and money).",Redline

0,"Well, it's pretty tasteless, most of the acting isn't too great, it has crap for plot, and it stretches out the punishment of it all to an excruciating 2 hours and 15 minutes. I don't think it should have been 1 hour and 15 minutes. The only singular thing that this heap has going for it is the nice cars. Let's face it, the cars are really nice. (And apparently all owned by one dude!) I am a pretty big car enthusiast, so when I see Lamborghini's, Koenigseggs, and Ferrari's all in one place, all in one picture, I kind of HAVE to see it. I'd have to say that Redline, while certainly not lacking in vehicular talent, has extremely low reserves of fuel when it comes to writing and directing talent. Possibly on empty.",Redline
1,"I like cars, so much so I actually have one. I like them in films, especially fast and fancy cars. That said,I also like plots in films, oh and acting, I like that too. Redline had a lot of cars but lacked certain other aspects of what may constitute a decent film. Actually, it lacked all other aspects. When I lie on my deathbed and look back at my life I will look upon the two and a half hours I spent watching this film and wonder why I didn't spending it nursing sick puppies instead.",Redline

5,"I can't believe people are hatin on this movie. It is awesome, of course it's not realistic but still entertaining. The acting is so bad, it's actually good.

Unfortunatly, this is not the case. The story line is lacking direction. The production values are terrible. There are just general things wrong about this movie that should be.

Mischa Barton did a fantastic job and tbh I find  she's not very good in lots of her horror movies but this was pretty good! I see lots of people comparing it to Misery but I don't think it's like that, sure there are some similarities in one particular scene but after that I don't think it was anything like it. I say give it a watch it, it's actually not so bad!",Homecoming
3,"Acting all around us good. It‚Äôs a Hollywood type liberals idea of coming home from war. In a program to help vets. Anti military pro individuals that served. All too predictive.

I never served, and have a respect for those that served- at any level, from National Guard to reserves to full time military service.",Homecoming

After all what is the problem the characters and what is the problem of the actors and what terrible casting choice! Mischa Barton? Jessica Stroup? My God, what crap performances! Nothing convincing and mediocre! And the characters? How can anyone be so stupid as Elizabeth? Or so naive as Shelby? After all, did not realize that the villain hiding Elizabeth in her own home is asking to be arrested?
Well, I can not criticize the characters because they do not exist, I have to blame is the direction, production, screenwriter ... By doing a story and totally incoherent gibberish that is!

Freeman's ""Homecoming"" features former The O.C. star Mischa Barton and 90210's Jessica Stroup in a predictable, but fun, twisty and dark fim loosley based on Stephen King's Misery. Barton plays the ex-girlfriend of Mike, a former quarterback at the local high school. After he arrives in tow with his new girlfriend, Elizabeth (Stroup), things take a turn for the worst when Barton's character accidentally runs over Elizabeth and holds her captive in her house. It's clearly a low-budget film, there's no special effects or any added hoopla, but if you want a few thrills, it's a good choice. Homecoming replays on Lifetime all the time but I'm not sure the television version shows Stroup bashing Barton in the head with a football helmet. Told you it was snarky.",Homecoming

I don't think that's the case for most of us. Also three months isn't that long for such high-school sweathearts, therefor I thought it would be more noticable in the beginning that Shelby was sort of hurt. The setting is a bit too familiar for this kind of thriller, it's almost a roadhouse setting. The soundtrack might be too intense for some. Too obvious I mean. The sceme Shelby plays is pretty sick, comined with the usefull background that's a strong point. The acting isn't that good, also obvious and rehersed. Only Micheal Landes as Billy does a better job. Elizabeth makes unbelievebly clumbsy moves, but at least that script tells her to try. Ofcourse half of the movie is based on Shelby winning Mike back and the nescessairy relational ups and downs make it more or less intresting. Shelby takes pretty radical messures at the end, so the finale isn't dissapointing",Homecoming

1,"*1/2 (out of four)

This is sort of a strange mix of ""Fatal Atraction"", ""Misery"" and any number of teen-oriented thrillers.  Granted, characters are fairly idiotic in most thrillers, but here they go beyond stupid.

Matt Long is Mike, a former high school football star who is returning to his small town where the school is going to have a ceremony to retire his jersey.  He is also bringing along his new girlfriend, Elizabeth to introduce to his family.  But his former girlfriend, Shelby (Mischa Barton) is still in town and she has never gotten over him.  She becomes very jealous when she meets the new girlfriend.  So much so that she kidnaps Elizabeth and traps and tortures her in her home.

The filmmakers make all the characters involved so moronic that I sort of hoped they'd get killed.  For example Elizabeth is trapped in the upstairs bedroom when Shelby gets a visitor downstairs.  Elizabeth must make a noise so he can hear her.  So she knocks over a few items.  Never once does she think about screaming.  She remains silent.  Then later she tries her best to attempt at opening the windows, but they won't budge.  She never consider actually breaking the glass.

I guess she deserves to be locked up if she doesn't want out all that much.  Maybe she is better off since her boyfriend, Mike isn't all that bright either.  He actually believes Shelby when she tells him that Elizabeth decided she wasn't interested in him and went home.",Homecoming

Mike's brother drops her off at the hotel and leaves, but the motel is full because of the football games. she is forced to walk 4 miles to the next motel. She tries flagging down vehicles for a lift, Mischa comes around the corner all upset and not paying attention and hits her......she brings' her back to her house and the rest is basically her in Mischa's house recovering, trying to get free or contact Mike.

0,"The only reason this is rated 10%, is because I am unable to rate it lower as it seems.

Homecoming is a very tame remake of sorts of the film Misery, based on Stephen King's book of the same name.

The main characters have had a huge overhaul, and rather than an adoring fan taking a writer prisoner after a car accident, it is a jilted girlfriend who's boyfriend failed to inform her that their relationship had ended kidnapping his new girlfriend, after a car accident.

Although it is an interesting modern take on the idea, I was hugely surprised that apparently ... it's not a remake of Misery.

No, I've searched the internet for any indication that it's a remake, and it just appears to be an updated rip-off. Yes there are different plot elements, but this is just another way in which writers try to distract people from the fact that something is a rip off of something else.

The acting is all right, but the film itself is very, very slow. I was waiting for something to happen, and forty minutes in, they had only discovered that Jessica Stroup's character Elizabeth was missing.

There are fairly laughable scenes, and the plot runs very slowly, with few scenes of real violence in comparison with many other films. Misery was all about the mental and physical torture of a writer by his adoring fan who was angered that he killed off her favourite character, whereas this is all about a pissy ex-girlfriend who injures her ex-boyfriend's current girlfriend when she tries to escape, and occasionally throws herself at her ex-boyfriend, each time to no avail.

I found myself losing interest a few times, probably because there isn't really much going on to spark any real interest in what is going on.

Yes, yes. I get the point that she knows he is coming. I don't need the same scene shoved in my eyes to overly reiterate something a figured out five minutes ago.

Another gripe I have with this film is the ""suspense"" for want of a better word ... is non-existent. Yes, there is suspenseful music - but it conjures no feeling of such a thing, even when something which is supposed to be suspenseful is also happening on the screen.

Some of the things that happen in this film are so predictable, it's almost painful.
It is also amazing how a man who has been shot in the foot can carry a fully grown woman out of a house, down some stairs and into town.

With an ending so very, very predictable, I must say this one thing.

This is one of the worst rip-off films I have ever seen.",Homecoming

While being a Thriller it's no where like as psychological as Misery, it's seems they have replaced the natural fear in the 'Kathy Bates like character with a little more gore. Interesting story still, just wish they had come up with something a little more original. I found myself feeling more and more sorry for Mischa's character.. her acts seemed more out of desperation then madness. Predictable, yes. Original, no.

2,"I'm one of few genre fans who enjoy Morgan J. Freeman's work. I enjoyed American Psycho 2 on some levels (yes, I'm hardcore for the original as well as the book) and don't think that Freeman deserves the slack he's been getting over the years. Here, he gets to take another swat at the beloved genre. I must say the storyline did draw me in, the characters were appealing, it took its time with a proper set up and it looked alright. I was never bored during this one. Freeman somewhat settled down for this movie, but he still gave some cool angles and added a sense of flair to the picture. Mischa Barton warmed up to me as the movie progressed. I wasn't blown away by her, but the more I watched her, the better she got (or could I have just been hot for her?). Jessica Stroup stood out the most for me and had me following her closely when she was on screen. Matt Long seemed very natural and likeable in his role. All these positive aspects, you ask ""what the hell's the problem?."" The story, although intriguing and grabbed my interest at first, got WAY too predictable for its own good. I think a sheltered 13-year-old could have figured what was going to happen next in this. Granted, that wasn't overly bad since I can predict a lot of movies these days and still like them. The story did not get better as the clock moved forward. They had the characters do some of the dumbest shit I've ever seen on film. I rolled my eyes several times and wanted to yell at them on occasion. Not because I was into it, but because I wanted to scold and cuss them down. For a movie that's about sex and violence, you would think that there would be at least some! There were some dark themes at play so there should have been some showcasing of said themes! Nothing from it. To an extent, I enjoyed this movie. It was technically good, with a decent story and a fast pace. But the lame plot turns, the predictability and the lack of nasties made this one a major disappointment for me. Catch it on TV or rental when you're bored and want something safe (and I mean SAFE). Decent.",Homecoming

0,Idiotic. The script answers the well known question about the monkeys left in a room to write Shakespeare. This was the first draft by the first monkey who threw it away only for Katie L. Fetting to find it and pitch it to an independent studio. The second monkey then arrived and promptly realised he had no aptitude for writing but was willing to direct. I'll call that monkey Morgan J. Freeman. Freeman's fine pedigree (American Psycho II: All American Girl and one episode of Dawson's Creek) combined with a deft ability to craft the sort of tension that you only get in post office ques as you decide which one to join should have ensured the film's success. Sadly due to Fetting's script which miraculously strips away all the characters ability to have logical thoughts leaves you feeling like your attending your own funeral and can't wait for it to be over because only a load of boring fuckers turned up anyway. The only thing that kept the blood moving around my body was Misha Barton who keep flashing hot then not like a Belisha beacon inducing semi-bone at times.,Homecoming

2,"This is an erotic thriller starring Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes.   It is seemingly low budget, despite the fact that it has a decent cast.   It is sexually exciting and it does build from a romance to something more, in a way that is foreshadowed early on.   The Direction is ""B"" at best.  The script is the same.   The eroticism is ""A"", despite it not being designed to be a soft core movie, per se.   The strength, quite frankly, is the acting.  Heather Graham is always watchable.   Jospeh Fiennes, in any role, has gravitas and makes him very compelling to watch.  I saw it on free tv, during a holiday weekend-so no complaints.",Killing Me Softly

Well...her early performances were terrible. Over acting chops here. Here dialogue with Heather Graham in the various meets were just laughable. Mcelhone overacts considerably. Unrealistic. Continuity errors. The girl Heather Graham goes to see, the one who said Fiennes raped her. She smoked 3 cigarettes in 2 minutes. It was a magic cigarette, it changed length and restarted a few times. Also  how could Joseph Fiennes run at breakneck speed to apprehend some cardboard cliche thief who stole Heather purse.(he wasn't even with her at the time) he was watching her, he ran miles, got him and beat him up and there was Heather Graham at the scene in seconds. She had blood on her face? he snatched the bag he didnt hit her. then Fiennes proceeds to snog her face off.  Also the police turned  up out of the blue. Everyone knows in London a call to the police can take a few weeks for them to come out.  More funny than believable.  damn it to hell.",Killing Me Softly

Based on a bestselling novel, a woman has a chance encounter with a mountain climber that leads to a passionate affair, but before long she starts to receive mysterious letters warning her that her lover is not the man that she thinks he is.  Graham and Fiennes have no chemistry together, which is detrimental to the film.  And the script does a rather poor job at developing the mystery and suspense; so much so that the twists and reveals have no impact.  Still, there's some intrigue to the story, and a few tense moments here and there.  A poorly made film, Killing Me Softly is ineffectual and formulaic.",Killing Me Softly

Predictable even miles away from it's narrative, Killing me softly is a poorly made film which can't even be suggested for it's erotic nature as even the sex scenes are tasteless.

0,"Although I did not have high expectations for Killing Me Softly, I can't pass up a chance to see Heather Gragam naked on screen.

The plot in Killing Me Softly is essentially completely senseless. There essentially is none because there are really no characters in the film, just the hollow shells of talented actors that are wasted on a lacklustre script full of clearly artificial dialogue. The film just charters through a ridiculous plot which makes no sense and makes all kinds of sudden twists and turns without a hint of originality or cleverness in them which really makes you wonder precisely how this film could have gone so wrong. It made literally no sense, and it just went all over the place with random new plot dynamics being thrown in every second to the dismay of the viewer. It is really a challenge to think of anyone enjoying this film because it was not the slightest bit good. It was frankly one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life.
As an erotic thriller, Killing Me Softly deviates between the focus on being romantically themed and being a thriller without ever consistently sticking to one. But either way it fails in bother areas because Killing Me Softly is not appealing for its erotic virtues as the nudity in the film was randomly thrown in for senseless purposes, and it is completely bereft of any thrills. Viewers are going to find themselves unable to be scared by anything in the film because the premise is full of every predictable movie cliche in the book. So Killing Me Softly completely fails in both areas as it is not sexy or thrilling in the slightest, and it takes itself way too seriously to even succeed as a guilty pleasure. The film is ridiculous and it follows a seriously generic style of storytelling and visual style as well so it has no surprises and nothing to set itself apart from the hundreds of other erotic thrillers, essentially all of which are way superior. Killing Me Softly is the worst example of an erotic thriller that I have ever seen because it loses touch with its erotic elements halfway through and always has an atmosphere which is way too light for it to ever be the slightest bit thrilling. I could not believe just how ridiculously off key Killing Me Softly was. I mean, it had the most generic visual style and the most ridiculous story which left it falling flat in every single area. The dialogue in the script was ridiculous and cringe worthy, but I am used to that in films. What I could not tolerate was the story because it had a single intention the whole film and yet had to go through so many ridiculously off key plot dynamics to actually tell it. It went into all kinds of unbelievable directions which sped up the pace and cemented the fact that it would take no time before viewers would lost interest in the film. Killing Me Softly goes off focus so many times and then randomly back onto it that it is just too easy to be worn down by the whole thing. And on top of that, it is just so boring. Killing Me Softly is not even at the right level of negativity to succeed as a guilty pleasure, especially because Heather Graham's nude scenes were senselessly thrown in and do not have the atmosphere which plays them gently into the film and ends up seeming more explotive, and not in a good way whatsoever. Killing Me Softly is a just a truly awful film.
The acting in the film is genuinely bad. All the actors give lacklustre performances, but the main issue is that despite the fact Killing Me Softly is supposed to be an erotic thriller, all the actors are so uninvolved in the atmosphere that they act way too lightly. This applies to every single cast member in the film. Rarely does the performance of every single cast member in a film fail to match up to the film in the slightest, but Killing ME Softly Blew me away with a lack of quality.
I always wondered why Heather Graham never had much of a mainstream career. If it is because she is paying for the sins of her performance in Killing Me Softly then it makes sense because her performance is so uninvolving and uninspiring that it is depressing. Even her nude scenes are brought down by the fact that she puts no charisma into the character, and she just seems so consistently lifeless from start to finish. Heather Graham does not tie herself into the atmosphere of the film well at all, and her performance ends up being potentially the worst of her entire career.
Joesph Fiennes is no better. His performance has him remaining too emotionally subtle and monotonous at the same time as he fails to channel in even a hint of heart to his performance. It is easy for him to mess up because he has literally no character to him, but it is hard to believe that he is at all savage because he is so pathetically shallow in the part that it is depressing to watch. He has literally no charisma and not the slightest bit of spirit in him, so it is easy to see how he has landed fewer and fewer leading roles in mainstream films these years. Killing Me Softly seems to be the film that really killed the talents of everyone involved.

So Killing Me Softly ends up being one of the most misguided and pathetic films in existence. It is not sexy enough to be erotic, not scary enough to be a thriller, not sensible enough in narrative to actually be an even semi decent film and so terrible that it is less likely to hit the viewers' list of guilty pleasures and more likely to strike their list of worst films in the history of cinema.",Killing Me Softly
3,"The only movie that I can think of off the top of my head that has gotten a 0% rating from Rotten Tomatoes.

2,"OK, Heather Graham is excellent",Killing Me Softly
4,"Killing Me Softly is a goofy, unintentionally funny, and oddly stylish erotic thriller. In the tradition of other goofy erotic/thriller films like Sliver, Color Of Night, Basic Instinct 1 & 2, In The Cut, and Passion (The 2012 Brian De Palma version), comes a film no fan of camp should miss out on. It is a gleefully stupid and hilarious film that is waiting to be discovered as the next camp classic. Marvel at the terrible script, gloriously awful dialogue, campy acting, jaw-droppingly awful plot twists, and artsy direction to complement the cheesy tone of the film, and you've got a howler of a film.

The film focuses on a woman named Alice who is a web designer from Illinois who is now living and working in London who enjoys her job and is even in a long-term relationship with a boyfriend whom she is living with. Still, something seems to be missing in her life.

That all changes during a chance encounter on the street with a man named Adam Tallis. During that chance meeting, there is an instant spark between the two, which results in an intense sexual encounter before they end up parting ways.

This one moment causes a massive shift in Alice's life, and she pursues the man who is named Adam, who is struggling with the guilt from a mountain climbing accident which cost the lives of all the members of his mountain climbing team, including his fiance at the time.

Alice ends up leaving her boyfriend and moves in with Adam, which soon results in a marriage proposal, which she is ecstatic about. But in the midst of such happiness, Alice begins to receive mysterious letters and phone calls warning her about Adam's past, which she blows off, going forward with the wedding plans (As well as more intense sexual encounters). But as the letters and warnings continue, a seed of doubt is planted in her mind, and she is determined to get to the bottom of the potential mystery at hand, unearthing shocking secrets that threaten her life.

The story has a lot of interesting ideas, but they are lost in a sea of cheesy character development, an abundance of trashy sex scenes, and plot twists that will have you simultaneously laughing and scratching your head as they unfold. The story is ultimately a mess of romance, thriller, eroticism, and other elements, culminating in many moments worthy of chuckles or outbursts of full blown laughter because of how utterly ridiculous they are. The story is only entertaining on a trashy, campy sort of level. However, I was legitimately compelled during the first 30 minutes of the film before it suddenly derailed into madness and hilarity. While I enjoyed the campy qualities quite thoroughly as a lover of B-movies, it's a shame that a promising start fell apart.

The actors try their hardest and I really can't fault them. It's the fault of a shoddy the script that ultimately dooms them, because they really do try to make the material work. I do have to compliment them for being able to retain a straight face, even during the particularly ludicrous moments of the film (Especially the last 15 or so minutes which produce some of the biggest gut-busting moments in the film). But I will legitimately compliment the performances of the leads, Heather Graham and Ralph Fiennes, because I do feel they did a solid job, even with all the ridiculous shit going on in the film.

Oh man, for entertainment, if you like thrillers filled with gaping plot holes, cheesy characters, and howlers for plot twists, you're in for a real treat, B-movie fan. If you come to watch this film looking for a legitimately good erotic thriller, you will hate it, and your head will probably explode trying to rationalize all the ridiculous things you are seeing.

Killing Me Softly is a glorious trainwreck for an erotic thriller. It's a B-movie classic that is waiting to be discovered by connoisseurs of crap because it offers so much entertainment value. Unless you are a B-movie fanatic, stay the hell away from this film.",Killing Me Softly

1,"Plays out like a poorly written and made, daytime TV-movie. The story is dumb and unoriginal. It's also handled badly with a pretty much non-existant conclusion. Really not worth your time unless you wanna see Heather Graham in the buff. Even still, you'll probably regret the decision to watch this.",Killing Me Softly
2,"This is an interesting movie with Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes. A bit on the surprising side, but the story plot was intriguing. This is intended to by a steamy thriller, but turns out very lame and not at all convincing. It tantalizes and doesn't deliver.

0,"The book is good... but why make so much changes in a movie and it's complicated. Still, I don't think Graham fits in this character. She's too cheerful and innocent for this 'Alice'. She doesn't own that attitude for such character... so poor.",Killing Me Softly
2,"Only an alright film. It moved way too quickly for the plot and characters to be established very well, and I saw the ending coming about twenty five minutes before it actually did. Not to mention I've never liked Heather Graham, and personally I think she ruined what potential there was. Good thing I only saw this for Joseph Fiennes, because he at least didn't disappoint. If you're male, you get the bonus in this film of clothes-less Heather Graham. If you're female, you get the same bonus, only with Joseph Fiennes. Good enough flick for fans of Joseph Fiennes, maybe, but that's about it.",Killing Me Softly

1,"Alice has reached a point in her life where she feels she needs more....sex. She has a great job and boyfriend who loves her, but with all this stability she wants something that is unstable. She meets Adam and is instantly attracted to him. Their first encounter is one of animal lust. He rips her shirt, kissing her chest and stomach leading down to you know where. At this point she can't take it anymore. She wants it NOW! So he lifts her up, carrying her to another room where they have sex on the floor while his cat watches. 

Several more encounters occur. Alice dumps her boyfriend and now lives with Adam, but She doesn't know a lot about him and when he asks her to marry him she automatically says yes. Blinded by her own lust, she doesn't see that she's married to a very dangerous man. At least she got the excitement she always wanted.

Some of the films dialogue is very laughable, but the direction isn't really that bad. It's quite good, the story is too awkward and makes me think of better erotic thrillers that are out there. This one is like a late night movie on Cinemax.",Killing Me Softly

2,"The storyline DRUG along. However, there were some very hot love scenes with two very beautiful people haha!",Killing Me Softly
3,"nice film, you ll know what killing me softly means!",Killing Me Softly
4,"Well, I had to review this film like this, whether the plot was the most sophisticated thriller, or whether the love scenes were copied from another film it was beside the point. Every woman would like to meet a man like Joseph Fiennes' character and be swept off her feet and have great sex and all the attention in the world. I think most of those who did not like the film must be men cause they know, they' don't have  the guts to be a man like that... ( i m kidding) well, I recommend this film as a truly romantic love story and the kinky sex was also not the point of the story. Girls, u will really love this film and Joseph Fiennes is, of course wonderfully gorgeous and convincing and lovable in every scene, and Heather Graham was beautiful. The wedding night idea was absolutely brilliant. ( hi hi )",Killing Me Softly

2,"lol Pretty bad movie. Story and script are pretty poor. Ending is moderately absurd. 

Joseph Fiennes puts in a good acting job. Natascha McElhone, whoever she is, was plain awful. 

The real reason why I rented this though was for Heather Graham. I knew this wasn't going to be a gem but heard she was in every scene so that was good enough. Her acting isn't nearly as hot as her lovemaking scenes. Hope she made some cash at least. 

As bad as it is, I still found it an easy watch. I hear the director is actually good and can't figure out why he would make such a bad movie--I mean after reading the plot, who would wanna make this? 

Skip.",Killing Me Softly

2,"Its Good But it just missing the Linch pin at the end,",Killing Me Softly
3,"Joseph Fiennes: Good..
Heather Graham: Average
Lady who played Deborah: Bad
Overall Movie: Average.. Timepass.. Sleazy..
Dialogues: Totally sucked.. for example, in one part where he has tied her in ropes and is questioning her, she asks him to untie her and when he questions why, she says ""I have to pee.""( LOL!!!!!!) and he actually lets her go!!!! :D",Killing Me Softly
2,Quite odd I have to say. I did not enjoy this movie and it was pretty predictable. When some of the characters talked I wanted to laugh because it seemed too cliche and contrived. The only good thing was Joesph Fiennes who plays the character of the incrediblely suspicious man while still being very charming.,Killing Me Softly
1,90% of the movie is sex. The movie ends with a fizzle. Two thumbs down for sure.,Killing Me Softly
3,"intrepid and sexy scenes, perfect for fantasies..",Killing Me Softly
3,"A sensual lustful moment that turns into a erotic lifestyle with murder involved. While it sounds good in theory it is a very basic movie with nudity as it driver, happy to see Heather Graham in this role I was put off by Joseph Fiennes as he looks as though is going to cry in every scene. Something to fill in an hour and half nothing more.",Killing Me Softly

There's not a piece of scenery left unchewed  by Quaid in what is easily his most over the top performance to date. (Yes, even more over the top than his cameo in that Bonnie Raiit video.)  Yet, Quaid's histrionics are what makes this film fun to watch. I recommend watching it ona streaming service, rather than spending real money to rent or buy it.",Beneath the Darkness
1,"Really, really bad acting.....",Beneath the Darkness
3,"It is great to finally see Dennis Quaid play a character with personality again! Lately, it seems like he plays the same scarred, emotionless character, over and over again. It's hard to remember that it's his charisma that made him a star and you can really see it in Beneath The Darkness. Dennis Quaid plays Vaughn Ely, a mortician who is bat shit crazy. To the town, Ely is this great guy who gives back to the community, but only one person can see him for what he really is. Travis (Tony Oller) is a local teenager who works odd jobs for Ely and has always had suspicions about the man, but never did anything about it. One night, the subject comes up while with his friends and they decide to bust into Ely's home to find out what he's really hiding. The story starts out very slowly and I wasn't expecting it to get any better, but it really does. I already mentioned how good Quaid is, but the star of this film is Tony Oller. I've heard him sing, but I've never seen him act, and to say I was impressed is an understatement. Between Quaid's outlandish behavior and Oller's teenage angst, I didn't need much of a story to follow in order to be entertained. Beneath The Darkness is strange and not everyone is going to like it, but it's one of these films that you keep watching, because you want to know what's going to happen. What happens is that it actually turns into a pretty entertaining and respectable film, that features a star in the making.",Beneath the Darkness

1,You can't judge a book by it's cover (or a movie by its poster) and Beneath the Darkness is one example. I kind of like the poster art and it was enough to suck me in... but the movie stinks. A group of teens start spying on a local mortician and discover that he keeps company with a corpse which he dresses and parades around his home. The guy catches them and from there the movie is formula. It's the kids word against the respected mortician and he starts playing threatening games with them. The movie has a made-for-tv feel about it and the only redeeming quality is Dennis Quaid's performance as the Norman Bates inspired killer. He has a lot of fun with the role but definitely overdoes it. His character becomes cliched and hokey and what starts as a redeeming quality soon becomes annoying and tiresome. The movie also has a shit title and it's not one I'd recommend anyone bother with.,Beneath the Darkness
2,"Four friends discover that the town's mortician has been doing some very strange things with the corpses, so they set out to expose him in BENEATH THE DARKNESS, starring Dennis Quaid. One part teen horror, one part necrophilic shocker... It would seem that BENEATH THE DARKNESS has much to offer the Horror audience, but this tame and tired thriller fails to spark even the least amount of interest. Dennis Quaid plays a rather weak villain. He is neither creepy nor intimidating, and often looks silly while attempting to be either. No one in the angst-ridden cast of annoying teen stereotypes even remotely comes forward as the film's hero, and they instead form a group of anti-heroes that break into the poor man's house without reason and get what they have coming to them. With no compelling characters, a questionable plot, minimal shocks, and only a handful of bloodless murders, BENEATH THE DARKNESS becomes a tedious viewing experience. It cribs nearly its entire structure from D.J. Caruso's DISTURBIA, but doesn't think to steal either its humor or suspense. Like Quaid's few hapless victims, this film is better left buried BENEATH THE DARKNESS.",Beneath the Darkness

3,"""Beneath the Darkness"" is nothing groundbreaking, but it's funny, entertaining and, yes, even a little scary. 

The story follows Travis (Tony Oller), a troubled teenager who has problems at home ever since he lost his sister. Which isn't to say he's maladjusted, as we can tell from his friends; token love interest Abby (Aimee Teegarden), average guy Danny (Devon Workheiser) and douchebag-with-a-heart-of-gold Brian (Stephen Lunsford). There's nothing wrong with these characters, really, there's just nothing particularly great about them either. So why on Earth do I give this film a high recommendation?

Two words: Dennis. Quaid.

Those who know me should know that I'm not at all a fan of Dennis Quaid. I really don't understand why he's had a career, he's just not a good actor. It's baffling. 

But this film totally makes his entire career worth it.

Dennis Quaid plays Ely Vaughn, the local mortician with a dark secret. The opening scene is actually quite effective and a little scary, but even the worst scenes of horror are elevated by Quaid's performance, which borders on TOO MUCH, but remains entertaining throughout.

Of course, the film is contrived. It's slow in parts, and it's not as scary as the best horror films. But Dennis Quaid is just a blast, and he really helps make this one of the best uses of ninety minutes I've had in recent memory.",Beneath the Darkness

As they try to investigate further, Ely gets more deranged and becomes even more unhinged, targeting the teens to make sure that his dark secret never gets out.

Why Randy Quaid would give his name to such a disastrous, monotonous, boring film I have no idea.  This is the type of drivel you'd find in a made-for-TV afterschool special or something.  The storyline has no shocking moments and no surprises, the actors are plain terrible, and you can even tell Quaid isn't liking the movie even though he's acting in it.

1,"Dennis Quad has been in an onslaught of films this year and last and his ressurgence into film, with disregard to a few gems like Footloose, has been a dissapointing affair altogether. I have not been impressed by any of his movie choices and ""Beaneath The Darkness"" is by far the worst choice. It's not that his acting itself if terrible because I actually found his role in this film to be the only, I mean ONLY, saving grace but no matter what kind of role the actors played there was no saving one of the worst horror films, maybe films in general, of 2012 so far. I will say that there was a sort of campy feel to the movie and if that was what they were aiming at than I suppose it wouldn't be so bad (I am a huge fan of 70's exploitation and 80's slasher flicks, not to mention the love I have for B Movie Horror) but the fact that the director and the entire crew it seems took themselves seriously and actually wrote this screenplay to be realistic is a laughing shame. I think Aimee Teegarden is an up and coming young actress and she has had a few descent roles in horror films recently including her role in ""Scream 4"" which was very good. Her role in this film wasn't terrible but the film choice itself is upsetting. The plot is a mess, every turn of the camera feels as if Ive seen it before, and I could literally forsee every scene in the movie, as could every body else that watched this movie. I am upset that I was talked into renting this film by a girl I hang out with because it really was a complete waste of my time and the filmakers time. It flopped in box office, it flopped in DVD sales, and it will flop in every aspect of the market. By the way, no there will be no cult following either, it's just a bad movie in general, I think Ive ranted enough. Avoid ""Beneath the Darkness"" unless you want something to laugh at even then it doesn't succeed.",Beneath the Darkness

He's so unbelievable as this psycho killer, & one might argue that that's the thing about serial killers - they seem so average & normal that no one ever suspects them. Still, he doesn't seem right for the part. 
Is he having trouble getting decent roles? The story is incredibly stupid yet it seems to be wanting us to take it seriously. Real cops would at least check the kids story out properly, I mean these are heavy allegations & someone did die of unnatural causes. There should have been an autopsy at least.

A pretty average teenager thriller helped only slightly by the inclusion of Dennis Quaid as the psychotic killer.  But the stupidity of many of the characters hinders the picture, making it at times laughable.

Dennis Quaid plays Ely Vaughn, a mortitian who also likes to kill for the thrill.  His home is thought to be haunted. At least the local kids think so.  A group of curious ones decide to investiagate, ending in the death of one of them by Mr. Vaughn.  The other kids set out to prove he is behind it.

A movie like this would not be able to exist without the stupidity of the police.  When the kids go to the police after their friends murder, the police simply say they don't believe them and it was an accident. No investigation.  Then later after another incident at the house they see a giant pit dug in Vaughn's backyard (it has a person in it) They go over to it an talk about the new tomato garden that is going in below the tarp.

Still later when the police guard the hospital room of an injured kid, they are supposed to keep everyone out.  But they change their tune when another kid sweet talks them with tales of football. Later they chase an escaping kid just to learn that it is the wrong kid.

I could go on, but would it ruin it for someone else.  I hope not!

But it's worth seeing if you're a bad movie cinephile for one reason: Dennis Quaid is hysterical! This is an extremely hammy role and nothing I've ever seen him do before. He swears and screams, he kills people after making over-exaggerated speeches, he punches women, his dialogue is unsubtle and insane... his role seems to have been written for Nicolas Cage. The plot is basically a mix of Disturbia and Psycho but with absolutely no suspense or scares. I know there main characters are supposed to be teenagers, but you'll only be interested in Quaid. There are laughs, but I'm not sure if they're intentional. Yes, Beneath the Darkness is a bad movie with an extremely unsubtle screenplay, but I think everyone involved making it had a fun time doing so and I had a fun time watching a lot of it.",Beneath the Darkness
3,"BENEATH THE DARKNESS is a new thriller starring Dennis Quaid as Ely Vaughn, a weird mortician with a few dark secrets.

Watching the movie on Blu-ray it immediately shows us that Quaid's character Ely is off his rocker big time so that leaves little mystery to the movie which is kind of a let down. We watch some high school kids, Travis (Tony Oller), Abby (Aimme Teegarden), Brian (Stephen Lunsford) and Danny (Devon Werkheiser) who get curious about Ely when they see him dancing with ""someone"" through his window, so they investigate, get busted  by Ely and one dies. The kids go to the authorities but it's hard to prove how their friend died since they broke into the home. So, with Ely and his secret exposed, what secret you ask? It has to do with his dead wife of two years that he dances with at night!


The kids tell the locals what they see but no one believes them because Ely is well loved by the community. They go back and forth with Ely during the movie and watching how Quaid handles his character really is creepy and shows how crazy this guy is. After a few close calls and narrow escapes our surviving teens finally come face-to-face one last time with him and learn one more long kept secret and Ely's past finally comes back to haunt him.

Beneath the Darkness is shot beautifully by director Martin Guigui and most of the movie takes place at night which really helps to set the tone . The story is ok and kind of generic but watching Dennis Quaid go crazy makes it worth watching! I've never seen him do a character like this! The movie doesn't really have any F/X because it's pretty much story and character driven but it could have helped the cause. Add a little mystery and a few F/X and this movie could have been much better!

Bottom line is if you're looking for a new thriller be sure to at least rent Beneath the Darkness. It's not the best but watching Quaid go crazy and flip out is worth the watch! I could watch it again simply because of Quaid's performance! Beneath the Darkness will be available on DVD and Blu-ray February 28th.  3/5

1,"This attempts to do for ""Psycho"" what ""Disturbia"" did for ""Rear Window"", update it for a teen audience, but where the latter film succeeded this fails miserably.
Quaid is cast against type as a deranged mortician who lives with the corpse of his wife. When a bunch of uncharismatic ""One Tree Hill"" type teens catch on to this, one of their number becomes his latest victim. As is usual in these films, the adults of the town don't believe them so they must expose him themselves. Quaid has fun with the role and plays it well over the top but his performance isn't enough to elevate a bland script.
The budget for this borefest was seven million dollars and it's hard to see where it was spent. Maybe most of it went to Quaid, it seems the only explanation for an actor of his quality appearing in something as bad as this.",Beneath the Darkness
2,"Well, very much predictable! Yeah, yeah, not a good movie, but I do anything to see Aimee!",Beneath the Darkness
4,This is a great movie.Good story line and great acting.Worth watching.,Beneath the Darkness

5,Kept me in the seat don't know why they have axe to grind maybe not enough blood or it made you think. Anyways kept me entertained. What do you expect in 2012!,Beneath the Darkness
4,I had fun watching this one!  Soundtrack is killer with some serious notables putting out some cool tunes.  I hope that they release a soundtrack!,Beneath the Darkness
2,It was interesting to see how everything came together after seeing the movie crew around town. I enjoyed watching to see those I know in the movie more than the movie itself.,Beneath the Darkness
2,"I'm sorry, I love Dennis Quaid, and I even am head over heels for Aimee Teegarden, but this film just did NOT work.  Dennis needed to have a director like Michael Mann was for Tom Cruise, in Collateral.  Quaid comes off as a caricature of a serial killer, and not for one second did I believe he was capable of murder.  Oh well.  Thanks Austin Film Festival!",Beneath the Darkness

3,"Great movie, excelent performance, true to the source material and awsome effects . Only drawback: not enough background music. There are scenes that would benefit from some songs.",Max Steel
5,"Honestly I don't get why people are insisting the movie was bad, I understand that it was a little slow paced at times but there was so much info the movie had to give to the audience about the origin of the aliens and stuff that if they had just dumped it all on us at once it just wouldn't have worked. The movie was great and i was blown away by the CGI. The movie had some issues but it definitely didn't deserve all the hate it got.",Max Steel

5,This movie was a nice fresh start to the beloved Max Steel toyline. I love this movie more than my first born child.,Max Steel
4,"A large herd demolished this movie because this opinion was popular among others. It's a very strong-middle superhero movie. It's about a symbiote, a friendship between a human and an alien robot. It has incredible computer graphics that typical Marvel movies with bloated budgets never dreamed of.",Max Steel
1,the movie was bad...but not 0%it had some real good effect but even for only 1 h 30 min I almost fell asleep it really didn't interest me it was not good at all but not that bad I would give it like 20-30%,Max Steel

3,OK movie that had great potential.,Max Steel
4,"I hear others disliked the movie but I quite enjoyed it. I didn't think it was unfunny nor dull. The movie had heart. it was a storyline that honestly had me wanting more. There was something else that could be offered by a stunning movie but because others have their own opinion on what a superhero movie should be like, this received a bad rating. In my opinion the movie was great as a start-up. Plain and simple.",Max Steel

4,"Not gonna lie, I did enjoy the film. But it could have been better, it deserves better. Max Steel is so Underrated and undersold. I really loved his cartoon series, and it was awesome seeing him in live action. But the film just felt too bland, and I wish that Max Steel would return back some-day and I hope that they would make it better.

Max Steel Deserves Better, and if they were going to make him return again, it would be instantaneously amazing. I love Max Steel, but if they were going to make another ""Live Action"" movie of Max Steel Again?

Please let someone else produce it, like Warner Bros or whatever. This character deserves to be loved again. And yes, FYI; I am a Max Steel Fan.",Max Steel

0,me wondering: why this movie exist?,Max Steel
0,"Words cannot define how unbelievably dull this film is. I watched this as a bored middle schooler with nothing to do over the summer break, and I regret it to this day. You would be more productive with your time sitting on the toilet even if you didn't need to use it than watch this film.",Max Steel
0,"The directing and execution of the plot (which had potential) is just plain insulting to the performance potential of the actors. I feel bad for them because no amount of good acting could have improved the ""creative decisions"". It feels like it was directed an AI that looked at 15 superhero movies and spit out a confusing script.
So bad, It made me excited to start an account, just to trash talk it. Random occurrences with zero context, cliche character development, Bad guy becomes good, good guy becomes bad, other bad guys become good, flip, spin, ""wow I'm powerful"", an attempt at the Iron-Man ""In-suit close-up"", punch, Kamehameha, Some CGI stuff, mommy loves you, end movie. 
-The fact there's people in reviews who genuinely enjoyed the movie, making the average 49%, is reason enough to never trust user reviews on anything. 
-Its not even awful in the sense its a cheesy B rate movie. There was a lot of effort into making this movie bad.",Max Steel
1,"Well, I gave this movie a try.  It had pretty good special effects for a $10 million dollar funding, it is a shame it's just so confusing and the ending still leaves big holes!",Max Steel
5,"This movie is a must see it absolutely changed my life, full of dramatic action and inspired dialogue don't know why this movie has such a bad score!",Max Steel
2,"I've seen worse, not that that's saying much...",Max Steel
4,Personally I enjoyed it though I haven't watch the series. Plan on catching up on it soon though,Max Steel
0,"Sadly, the 0% score comes off as completely warranted with the few good things about it, such as the costume and maybe one or two sincere performances not being of sufficient enough quality to keep me from giving this movie more than half a star. It's dull and repetitive, the lead's dynamic with this robo-alien thingy called Steel is nowhere near as entertaining as, to give an example, Venom & Eddie Brock, it's hard to get immersed in this world when it comes off as depressingly empty, I don't really care about the protagonist's daddy issues and the revelations and, most infamously, there's barely any action in this movie. Which, you know, tend to be the main selling point of a frickin' superhero movie, even in origin stories. Only one proper fight happens and that's near the end with minimal superheroics before that. No saving somebody from getting run over or the hero using some random criminal lowlifes as target practice, just stuff about a psychic connection while the actor screams and keeps telling his crush/girlfriend ""I'm sorry, I have to go"". I'd have hoped that Mattel's attempt to start their own toy-based movie franchise might have been raked over the coals hard by critics but sadly I have to agree that, if it weren't for it being immediately forgotten, lacking anything to help it stand out in a genre that, by the time this movie came out, was understandably being increasingly met with concerns that it would be in danger of getting oversaturated and dying a quiet death at the box office, it could easily have qualified as unequivocally one of the worst superhero movies of all time.",Max Steel
5,Good movie personally think needs sequel,Max Steel
0,this is so boring and a totally cliche,Max Steel
3,"While it's not spectacular, Max Steel is a wholesome, innocent, breezy superhero movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family without any reservation. 

Director Stewart Hendler does the best he can with what he is given; a weak script and a measly $10 million budget. But he crafts a unique, fun origin story that's VERY pretty to look at with his wonderful color grading and cinematography coupled with some very creative sky replacements. 

If there was more faith in this movie and if Stewart Hendler had more resources, better people, and a budget the same size as your average DC or Marvel movie, I truly believe that he would have made the next Hollywood franchise-starter and added another unknown superhero to the public eye.",Max Steel

4,I liked the adaptation from the cartoon.,Max Steel
0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,Max Steel
4,The movie was not bad.  It's spent too much time in telling the back backstory and not enough time on action and hero scenes. The writers for the movie should have watched any reboot of Spider-Man to see how it's done.  If they ever make a second movie I'll watch it.,Max Steel

5,"Alright, Fam. You need to see this one, Very compelling story with great and intense action scenes and a villian better than Thanos, Mans Not Hot",Max Steel
4,"I'm not sure what everyone's problem is.  I LIKED this movie.  Quite a bit, in fact.

It's been several months since I watched it, but I remember it had some plot twists that were quite entertaining.  There were some ""big reveals"" that caught you off guard (unless you already knew the story somehow).  And Max's reaction to and handling of suddenly getting superpowers was both believable and entertaining.

If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch it for free right now.  It's well worth the time, especially for young teens.",Max Steel
3,"This is a fun movie but it's nothing special. I don't mean that in a mean way, not at all because I quite enjoyed it really. The acting was good, so was the animation and the camera work. It's just wasn't great. I do want to say that I really enjoyed Ben Winchell as Max, he was very good.

You know, it's a cool story and it's very enjoyable movie. You won't miss much if you don't watch it, but still, if you do, it's good.",Max Steel

0,More boring than watching trees grow in slow motion. I wish there were zero star ratings.,Max Steel
2,Surprisingly bad. One of those movies where the main plot driver is the bad decisions made by the main character. Unremarkable acting.,Max Steel
3,"The protagonists may be likable but they're part of the film as a whole that's trying to be an average superhero flick when it's only expositional and nothing much was established nor developed enough to counter its own sense of ""logic"" with sensible plot points, which overall makes it predictable and Garc√≠a's new low confirmed that. (C+)

(Full review TBD)",Max Steel
1,Did not enjoy at all,Max Steel
5,"I ENJOYED it. I kept wondering where its been hidden all this time. A fun, Imagina movie, a ""new"" superhero, and its not a DC Nor marvel creation. Its not a complex story, but thats good too. I wanted SOMETHING fun and new to see tonight, and i am VERY Hapy with my choice. WOW! Just wow! I liked it, a lot!",Max Steel
4,"The acting and directing are good; the plot ends with uncertainty -- a nebulous ending. The tv series ""eureka"" had the same problem.",Max Steel
5,Excellent movie - this is lighthearted fun which is in short supply these days.  Thank God this isn't another Dark Knight or other such violent depressing fare - this is a great family oriented super hero movie - along the lines of the first Superman with Christopher Reeve.  If you like fun movies you'll enjoy this - if you take super hero movies seriously - you won't.,Max Steel

But when I watched it the second time it's few action scenes entertained me well enough to enjoy it almost as much as the show. I wish it had earned enough money to make a sequel.",Max Steel

0,"WORST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER. Yes, even worse than Batman & Robin, Catwoman, and Fantastic Four (2015). Worst film of 2016. Why are there so many stupid bots giving stupid, false positive reviews and ratings? Why are so many idiots making false positive reviews in Spanish? Must be a bunch of stupid little kids or people from the studio to try to promote this movie by making many fake accounts and making false positive reviews to watch this god-awful movie. Max Steel is an atrocious film. It is an absolute trainwreck. It is completely forgettable, lifeless, and downright boring. The lead actor is terrible. Ben Winchell is miscast as Max McGrath. If you don't know or remember him, he's the guy who played Dixon in a few episodes of A.N.T. Farm and played Eddie Earl in one episode of Jessie. Of course you wouldn't expect much from a Disney Channel star. Max Steel is without a doubt the worst film of 2016. It is an absolute trainwreck from beginning to end. Josh Brener is severely miscast as the voice of Steel. Josh Brener was so annoying as the voice of Steel. His voice and lines were extremely irritating. Josh Brener does a horrible job at voice acting. Hollywood should never allow him to do voice acting ever again. The main character, Max McGrath, is really wooden, boring, humorless, and underacted. The villain twist was very predictable. The plot is nonsensical. The movie's script is tone deaf. The characters are very cliche. The editing in this movie is atrocious. Arguably even worse than the editing in Suicide Squad. This is a super cliched superhero film. Max meets his crush (Sophia Martinez) by being run over by her accidentally at school. Very cliche way of a hero meeting his love interest/crush. In some parts of the movie, she randomly and coincidentally shows up near him while she is driving in her truck which is just super weird and seems too coincidental to not be incidental. It almost seemed as if she was stalking him wherever he went while she was in her truck driving. I find that creepy... 40 minutes or so into the movie, Max meets Steel and eventually Steel forms together with Max so they can become ""Max Steel"". Steel basically just transforms into an armored flying suit of steel which Max wears. Max is barely Max Steel in this movie and when he is Max Steel, he doesn't even really fight crime and any enemies in this movie until the third act when he confronts Dr. Miles Edwards who has his own somewhat similar suit of steel armor (that's red and black) and becomes the supervillain known as Dread. So Max Steel eventually defeats him in probably the most cliche and cartoonish way possible by giving Dread all of his power and when Dread drained too much power from him, he overloaded and died (and I think he might've exploded). So his mom comes along and finds him hurt and unconscious on the floor in the factory after he killed Dread. Then after that night, the next morning, he wakes up on his bed and she is happy and relieved to see her son awake and alive. And she's happy to see Steel back since Max's dad was alive. Yeah, turned out she knew about Steel and knew who he was. Then Max goes to Sophia's house and sees her and thanks her for her help with finding out about Dr. Miles Edwards' evil scheme. So he kisses her and they smile and he becomes Max Steel and flies off to school instead of walking there like he usually did. This movie was just so BORING and pointless to watch. Max Steel is officially the worst superhero film of all time. Max Steel has dethroned Batman & Robin as the worst superhero film of all time. This movie is just no fun at all. It all looked and felt like a fan-made film. The trailers weren't even good, but the movie was even worse than the trailers. No wonder this movie bombed so hard with critics and at the box office. I highly do not recommend this movie at all. It is a total waste of time.

0,"OH, JESUS F***! This movie should have never been made. No matter how starved you are for somethin' to watch, there's gotta be a better option than this flop. For starters, Dennis Rodman may be good at basketball, but on film, he's just a one-trick pony. And if he actually made a profit, Rodman ain't gettin' nothin'. After a token fast break in theaters, ""Simon Sez"" just dribbled over to video stores. But Simon says ""Avoid this misguided 'Die Hard' knock-off."" For experts, just avoid this. IMO, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, should avoid this ultra depressed thriller that tries, and fails, to be James Bond. You want spy films? Watch 007 movies, nothin' wrong with that.",Simon Sez

3,"Former CIA agent ""Simon"" (""The Worm"" Dennis Rodman) is living in France minding his own business when a guy claiming to be a former classmate in a CIA training class shows up. ""Simon"" doesn't recall who this guy named ""Nick Maranda"" (Dane Cook) is. 

""Miranda"" is there to deliver a $2-million ransom for the kidnapped daughter of a businessman (Clayton Day). But the deal explodes in his face, and ""Simon"" has to use his hand-to-hand battle skills to get them out of there. After escaping, they run into a beautiful blond (Emma Sjoberg) with martial arts skills that are pretty much equal to ""Simon's"". She also wants the suitcase, and it is pretty obvious that she and ""Simon"" has a past together. 

Back at ""Simon's"" place, he and ""Miranda"" discover that the suitcase is actually filled with two heavy metal bricks and a computer disc. The two take the disc to ""Simon's"" secret base under a French monastery where two computer experts disguised as monks (John Pinette, Ricky Harris) try to decode the encripted program on the disc. 

""Simon"" and ""Miranda"" then go after the daughter (Natalia Cigliuti), who is in love with the son of the kidnapper. And she doesn't even know that she is being held for ransom. 

Now, ""Simon"", ""Miranda"" and at least one unlikely ally join forces to get the girl back. 

Let me tell you something that will be painfully obvious with the first few minutes of the movie -- Rodman is the best actor in the entire cast, except for maybe Sjoberg. The problem is that the supporting cast just tries too hard to get a laugh from the audience, and their jokes just bomb. The lead villain is completely insane -- and not in a good way. He is over-the-top and not a good villain. And the reason he wants the disc is really lame -- he wants to destroy a famed French landmark because he is sick of looking at it. 

The other thing that makes this movie pretty watchable is the martial arts fights. The fights are nicely choreographed, and are at a good pace. However, you can tell when the cast is replaced by stunt people in these scenes thanks to how they move when they are obviously wearing a harness and their faces are being hidden by the distance of the camera, a body part or a prop they are holding. 

The writing is not that good in this movie. The plot twists are poorly done in this movie, and they come across as confusing. Some of the characters who appear to be a villains turn out to be the good guys, and their turn completely escapes you. 

Another problem with this movie is that there is very little chemistry between the cast. Cook is obviously being carried by Rodman on-screen, and he is obviously trying too hard to be the comic relief. On the other hand, Sjoberg and Rodman are a bit better on-screen, but I had a little problem believing that they were a couple prior to when the film takes place because there was no spark between them. It only became obvious that the two were attracted to another when they jumped into bed while having another martial arts fight. 

Special effects in this movie is fairly typical. However, they really were cheap with the computer graphics in the villain's super computer screen. This movie was released in 1999, but it appeared that the super computer graphics were done earlier in the decade. 

I would suggest that you only see it for the fight scenes and, shockingly, Rodman.",Simon Sez

0,Not to be taken seriously. I mean that with all sincerity. If you do you will be apalled and possibly mentally scarred at how abhorrently and catastrophically bad this film is. I know I haven't been the same and I already see a shrink. (Note the 1/2 star rating). All you have to do is watch the first 15 minutes of this steaming dog pile and your brain will forever be rendered cottage cheese and films will forever be ruined...or at least until you pop in Ben Hur or No Country for Old Men and realize that cinema isn't dead...yet.,Simon Sez
1,Awful thriller with degenerate acting.,Simon Sez
2,"In some alternate universe, people believed that using non-actor celebrities like popular musicians and actors was a sound idea and investment...oh wait, that's MY universe. After captivating audiences (note: sarcasm) with his debut in the Van Damme vehicle ""Double Team"", Dennis Rodman shows up to do more carefully choreographed kung-fu as Simon, a renegade Interpol agent (because they would totally hire someone that looked like him...right?) whose in the middle of an investigation until old acquaintance (played by a then unknown but still VERY unfunny Dane Cook) comes into town to settle a hostage negotiation with a briefcase carrying only a single disc that helps to program a massive laser gun that can destroy anything. Lots of PG-13 friendly action ensues as the European streets are filled with American good guys running around and beating up a bunch of bad guy Europeans. This movie goes beyond the boundaries of being ridiculous. Thank goodness Rodman's acting career never fully took off as well as director Kevin Elders never directing again, cause both these guys are turkeys! This film's only redeeming quality: it's enlisting of several comedians in supporting roles! Despite Cook being completely unfunny and dumb, he manages to appeal to a world of dumb people, who would probably somehow find his humor in this film still funny, despite how bad it is. Still, there's also the comedy relief in the form John Pinette (who I love!) and Ricky Harris, playing Micro and Macro, two technology-savvy, wise-cracking monks who provide this films only genuine laughs. Otherwise, Simon Sez is complete and utter trash.",Simon Sez

0,While this isn't the worst thing that is on dane cook's resume. it's bad when he's the comic relief and he's not the only thing in this movie that is unintentionally funny. he is made to pay for being in this film through all the pratfalls you can even feel his embarassment as he acts in this movie. but exposure is exposure and it's a check. it's hard to believe there is a man who works in the security industry who is black over six feet tall skinny with tons of piercings tatoo's and bleach blonde hair.but is not supposed to be noticeable. that's not all the hard to believe details. this film is horrible cliched squared. it's like a kids action film with adult themes and when i say kids i mean 5-12 year old's who are the only one's who would find this film interesting. definately skip or watch with the help of chemicals where after watching you won't believe what you saw it had to be the influence but if you watch it again sober you realize no it was that stupid,Simon Sez

5,"I think David Arnott did an outstanding job performing as an ordinary teen boy in key West in the 1970s. This is how boys acted in my neighborhood growing up.  Not real demonstrative emotional thoughtful or expressive all the time. 

It's refreshing to see the the quiet tones of reality performance. Hollywood more often casts boys who are unusually expressive sensitive and brilliant and the result is an entertaining stimulating performance but not real. And those real boy performers often turn out to be gay... Not regular straight kids from the neighborhoods We all grew up in.

It's interesting ...I read the director of this film also a cinematographer on the British film KES. That is a British film that has become a classic and in that film again they did reality casting for the kids and it made all the difference... they also didn't cast emotional creative Hollywood performers for the kid roles. They also cast real kids who were not always doing great performances but just being normal.
.

The film follows the investigation of the eye patch wearing stolen art detective Harold Smith. Anonymous voicemail recordings of possible leads support a colorful cast of characters including a Boston newspaper reporter, a series of conmen and art thieves, the shadow of Boston thug Whitey Bulger, an informant with a bad smoking habit and the name Turbocharger, and the long arm of the Irish Republican Army. The best performance comes, unexpectedly, from an employee of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum when he utters the unforgettable line, ""You're mine, and you'll know me all of your life.""

Very interesting main theme with the theft of a series of paintings from the Isabella Gardner Museum in Boston, but the sub story, with voiceovers of Isabella and her buyer (who I couldn't help thinking must have done very well out of the whole arrangement) got a bit much, and I was wishing for the remote control to fast forward through those segments by the end. The detective was a very interesting character. Would have liked to have heard more about him. Wait for the DVD and rent.

2,"A fairly entertaining documentary that suffers from trying to tell two stories at once.  While other docs have done this well, this one feels less focused.  The main story here is trying to track down stolen paintings and taking a look at the seedy world of art crime. If it had just focused on that, I think this would have been a better film.  Instead there are segments of correspondence between Isabella Gardner and her art buyer.  This feels like padding and should have been cut down or better focused (the point is to show that even Gardner had to smuggle some paintings).  And then there are whole interviews that don't seem to belong, like the Museum employee who has an interesting adoption story.  A decent documentary that needed to be better focused.",Stolen

3,"Adequately suspenseful and amply jarring, Derailed is a fairly generic, yet ripened suspense thriller embedded in a predictable and churlish narrative that weaves gossamer threads of drama and mystery across its suitably gritty palette of aesthetics. 

Individually, Jennifer Aniston, Clive Owen, and Vincent Cassel are assets to the film's long-range impact, but their respective characters -- and the interpersonal relationships formed among their characters -- are poorly developed, which bolsters two-dimensional character designs in spite of the actors' talents. The lack of depth in these characters also sufficiently debases their relatability and admonishes any compassion one might feel towards them even when they are targeted by misfortune throughout the film. It is difficult, after all, to elicit concern or sympathy from the viewer when they haven't been given enough material to attach themselves to the characters. 

However, Jennifer Aniston proves, once again, she can fulfill her duties in a serious role, even if she wasn't as powerful here as she had been in The Good Girl (2002) with co-star Jake Gyllenhaal. Clive Owen offers his usual dark eyes and fastidious movements so suited to the genre. The chemistry between Owen and Aniston certainly registered, but it came across flat, and this was distracting because it was a hinderance to the film's credibility. Vincent Cassel, an otherwise great performance, had a tendency to push the limits of his performance in a way that felt forced and contrived at times. Nevertheless, performances were generally staunch when it came to fueling the plot.

1,"""Derailed"" is a ridiculous thriller that only gets worse as it goes along. The whole film depends on the main character (played by Clive Owen) being the most gullible, suggestible and idiotic victim of blackmail in the history of mankind and it becomes so infuriating you'll need to take breaks during the film to scream out in rage. A quick resume of what happens in the movie to give some context: Charles Schine works in the advertising industry, is married to Deanna and has a daughter that's type 1 diabetic. The two parents work non-stop to save up money in order to get their daughter some medical help and pay off their second mortgage on the house. One day, ""Charles"" meets ""Lucinda"" (played by Jennifer Anniston) on a train, the two hit it off and start having an affair, but when they go back to a hotel room, they're victims of a vicious crime. The criminal in question is ""Philippe"" (played by Vincent Cassel) who proceeds to blackmail ""Charles"" for outrageous sums of money. So you might be able to think of some problems with this set up from the beginning... like ""Why is Charles going along with this instead of calling the police?"" Well the answer to that question is because he's a total moron. It doesn't take a genius to realise that the reason why a criminal would tell you ""not to contact the police"" is because the police would be able to solve the whole affair quickly. It also doesn't take a genius to realise that if you give a blackmailer some money, they're not going to go away. You almost want ""Philippe"" to succeed with his plot because you have no sympathy for someone who would be stupid enough to give all of his money to one of the most transparent and one dimensional villains ever seen on screen. He's so evil that he casually goes around beating up people (even in their own house), threatening people over the phone and even commiting murder to get his blackmail money. The guy feels like a total amateur at the whole blackmail thing because he's just leaving evidence everywhere but thankfully he's picked the biggest pushover ever as his victim.

As the movie goes, there are several scenes that feel very awkward and create plot holes for the film. In one scene that cements ""Charles"" as a total fool, he is speaking to a police officer when he gets a call from the blackmailer. It doesn't take a titan of intellect to think that maybe if you passed the phone onto the detective while making a ""shh, just listen"" motion, you would probably be able to set the bad guy up to confess his crimes to the police right there and then! Because this is a thriller that does rely on some twists to keep itself going, it would be wrong to write down all of the scenes that have logical problems in them but particularly towards the end these become more and more obvious. It's just really hard to believe that the man who has been saving money for years for his daughter to get better would just throw it away because he was almost unfaithful to his wife. For that reason the movie really doesn't work but it is, at the very least entertaining throughout. Sure, it will drive you mad looking at these fools making the dumbest choices possible while dealing with this whole blackmail plot but you won't be able to turn it off because the movie consistently tops its own stupidity. Other than that, Jennifer Anniston sure looks good trying to seduce Clive Owen and the performances are decent too.

The plot of ""Derailed"" is utter nonsense but it does stay consistantly more interesting as it goes along and even though the characters are surprisingly stupid you'll still be curious to see what happens to them; it might not be good but there is some entertainment to be found here.

2,"Pretty decent thriller that has some decent twists and turns, Not too predictable but if you've seen enough of the genre not hard to figure out. A better wrap up of the end plot would have been preferred instead of the jumbled mess we got instead and because of that a rating of a little above 2 stars is all i can muster. Good performance from Clive Owen, Vincent Cassel and a not so great performance from Jennifer Aniston who i guess was trying to add suspense thrillers to her resume like her arch-rival Angelina Jolie.",Derailed
5,"damn, this movie was the classic lesson in what can happen if you decide to cheat!!

2,Mildly entertaining.,Derailed
3,"So I was gonna watch the JCVD thriller called 'Derailed' but after the first five minutes I realised I had the wrong film haha so I stuck with this despite Aniston being involved.

Honestly I was pleasantly surprised with this thriller, you don't think its a thriller and you don't see the quite decent twist in the plot, but its actually pretty good. I won't go into the plot for fear of spoiling it but its all about double cross, setups, scams...basically naughty lying laced with blackmail.

Bottom line the film is carried by an excellent performance from Cassel who is really quite evil looking and convincingly aggressive. His scrawny frame is deceiving as is his change in character to get into Owen's life which gives him the kind of presence that sends shivers down your spine, the fact that he won't stop makes him nasty and scary.

Owen does a good job as the husband in dire straits as he battles against the demands of Cassel's character, he looks the everyman and plays it well. Unfortunately Aniston simply cannot shake her comedic background and just cannot convey a decent performance in drama as far as I'm concerned, she just isn't convincing, purely a TV actor period.

For some reason someone thought the casting of 'Xzibit' and 'RZA' was a good move for this film, errrr no, they add nothing in their roles and I don't understand why they were even considered when simple more toned down characters would have been better. And can someone explain to me whenever these 'musicians' are cast in films the end credits always seem to role with a lame rap song? is that part of their deal or something!? completely wrong choice of music for the end credits here, totally ruins the feel.

From a slow start which feels like its gonna be crap to a pretty good thriller which does get you involved as the plot gets deeper. I didn't see the plot U-turn and it really makes things interesting as you root for Owen's character, before that its a little annoying as you tend to blame Aniston for his ever mounting problems but after the twist you see why.",Derailed

Aniston's character Lucinda Harris plays on the men's hormones by being interested in them.  Harris partner  Vincent Cassel's character is the heavy who stages a situation where blackmail is involved.  Clive Owen shines in his role as the mark!  How Clive Owen deals with the bad situation creates many exciting plot twists.  The movie has a strong message where one man's mistakes can effect another and creates collateral damage.  A good movie  four stars out of five.  A great thriller!   Worth buying.",Derailed

This Hitchcock-flavoured thriller features Clive Owen as Schine, a married businessman about to begin an affair with a fellow commuter portrayed expertly by Jennifer Aniston.

THRILLER

  A married husband (Clive Owen) with a daughter starts to have an affair with an already married woman (Jennifer Aniston) is when things start to get worst for the family man!

I hope Jennifer does a lot more movies like this to get rid of the good girl type cast. I really liked RZA, his acting was great and his character was believable and very funny. The movie was fast and edge of the seat almost from the start. I found some parts predictable but that didn't ruin the movie for me.

I definitely recommend this movie.",Derailed
3,"I can not understand the negative reviews on this movie... it is just a thriller, and delivers everything thriller should have! Yes, there is some old stuff in it but it is well done! Very well directed by the Swedish director Mikael H√•fstr√∂m (for his 2003 movie, Evil, received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film), written by Australian screenwriter Stuart Beattie (Collateral), and co-starring French actor Vincent Cassel (Ocean's Twelve), who in the movie is the 'rapist'. When you think honestly, everything is in expectations... because this is not an Academy Award film, and most of people expected just that from this director. I can't find it 'derailed' from his style (Vendetta-1995, Days Like This-2001, Evil-2003, Drowning Ghost-2004 and 1408 from 2007) which is not fresh but recognizable! Roger Ebert, a critic from Chicago wrote the following ""Clive Owen was my candidate for James Bond, and can play hard and heartless rotters (see ""Closer""), but here he is quiet and sad, with a sort of passivity. He lets his face relax into acceptance of his own bad fortune. Jennifer Aniston does that interesting thing of not being a stereotyped sexpot but being irresistibly intriguing. That works with a man like Charles. Happily married, in debt, worried about his daughter and his job, he would be impervious to a sexy slut."" Well said... and well done!",Derailed

We all know that might doesn't make right, unless you're a Hollywood writer.  We know, that no matter how much we feel that we're in the right, that that big burly guy (especially if he breaks legs for a living) is going to hand us our asses in a fight.  This is something that Charles Schine (Clive Owen) finds out first hand in this suspenseful thriller.

He's just a regular family man trying to cope with a family with a special-needs daughter.   Charles tempts his fate by flirting with a stranger, Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) on his commuter train.  This flirting evolves into a date and soon they're getting a hotel room.  While things are getting started, somebody breaks into their room, knocks Charles out and savagely rapes poor Lucinda.

The thief is now blackmailing and threatening Charles, and no matter how hard he tries, he can't seem to stop this man.  Charles also feels guilty for not protecting Lucinda, who also wants to keep this event quiet.  A police detective Church (Giancarlo Esposito) is somewhat aware that something is happening, but is powerless to stop it.

Charles begins to be exposed to this gritty underworld and we're all surprised by the twists that this movie takes, later on.",Derailed

4,"This is a very well done Thriller with the perfect amount of cop/detectives influence.
The plot twists are what make this movie a must see because it will get your attention immediately after it starts. You don't expect some of the tragic events happening to a ""normal"" guy like Clive Owen's character and that's why it gets very interesting.
The acting is specially good from Owen, Aniston, and mainly Cassell; the guy steals the show. Owen once again demonstrates he's a very talented actor who can carry the whole movie on his back.
The direction is solid and even classy.",Derailed
3,"Once you've seen one con movie you've seen them all. Maybe I'm too used to seeing Aniston in happy roles, as this role disturbed me alot. It takes a sick kind of person to fake being raped.

0,Awful. Awful. Awful.,Derailed
3,"I was caught completely unawares by this. Recorded it on my freeview + and assumed that it was a rom-com of some variety considering the presence of Jennifer Aniston. I guess the pressence of Vincent Cassell, who was excellently villianous throughout, should have tipped me the wink as to what i was going to be seeing.
What i did get was a great thriller, with a couple of nice twists and turns and a few shocks, played out by a great cast. A nicely underplayed Jennifer Aniston, a suitably naive and bemused Clive Owen. Both leads are supported by the gorgeous but exausted Melissa George, the afforementioned Cassel, a couple of Rappers and even a short part from the excellent David Morrissey.
I would guess that most people would see the big twist coming but there are a couple of places where the story is clever enough to throw in smaller shocks and twists which are not as telegraphed. This is nicely paced, suitably changes colour palate between the home and worklife life of Owen and the grit and grime of the NY underworld.
All in all this was a good little movie that should be better recognised.",Derailed

Also our french friend, Vincent Cassel, delivers an awesome cocky part as the skilled villain. Derailed as a title perfectly states the proces of the movie and with what Charles is dealt with.

2,"I once took a screenplay writing course at UCLA over the summer of my sophomore year of high school. At the end of the course the class shared a scene from the screenplays they had been working on. During the presentations, I remember being blown away by the originality of many of them. The fact that there is little chance of seeing those ideas come to the big screen, while screenplays like the one in ""Derailed"" still make it, is proof that America has no taste. ""Derailed"" is a tightly packaged piece of sensuous schlock that's based on a book of the same name by James Siegel but feels like it was sent straight from the screenplay factory. It follows all the textbook formulas for a seductive thriller and after seeing it, you'll likely feel deja-vu. Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is an advertising executive manager who's feeling tired from the strain of his sinking marriage, the constant alert he has to pay to his bedridden daughter, and the overall banality of his everyday life. Then, on the train to his work, he meets Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) after she pays for his ticket. He strikes up a conversation with her and after going out for lunch a couple times, they go drinking and then one thing leads to another. They decide to spend the night at a seedy motel, get cozied up in their room but just before they can proceed, they're robbed at gunpoint. The armed man, LaRoche (Vincent Cassel) steals their wallets, beats Charles, rapes Lucinda, and then runs off. Lucinda tells Charles not to go to the police, in fear of her husbands wrath if he finds out she was having an affair, but complications ensue when LaRoche begins asking Charles for steadily increasing amounts of money. ""Derailed"" follows a fairly straight forward formula and rarely goes off the tracks of predictability. Mikael H√É¬•fstr√É¬∂m does a fine job of directing the movie but fails to deliver much suspense or plausible surprises. Both Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston try to best to bring the lackluster script to life, and while their acting is well done and their feeling for each other are believable, I never felt like I was a part of their lives. Especially in Clive Owen's case, I never felt connected to him or his problems, which is essential for thrillers that deal with the risks of adultery. However it's not Clive Owen's fault for this, it's the screenplay, which requires it's presumably intelligent characters to behave idiotically until the obvious slaps them in the face. If you watch movies casually, you'll likely see the twists coming way ahead their delivery, leaving you bored as the characters have to catch up. ""Derailed"" isn't a bad movie per se, but it isn't a very good one either and it definitely isn't something you or I haven't seen before. In essence, it's a cautionary tale which basically says that lying is bad and will only lead to more lies, however It doesn't go any deeper than that and remains an on-the-surface, done-already thriller that simply isn't worth your time.",Derailed

2,"Wagons East isn't the worst comedy I've seen, but it's definitely not a trailblazer. The script feels like it was cobbled together by amateurs, with actors mostly winging it during each scene. The jokes are half-baked and delivered half-heartedly by a seemingly disinterested cast. The basic concept of people going back east because they didn't like the west is amusing, but I don't think this movie knew what to do with it. And it's sad that this is film is part of John Candy's final legacy. I kept waiting for one good laugh as I watched Wagons East, but the best it got out of me was an occasional smirk.",Wagons East!
2,"Set design, wardrobe & cinematography were fantastic. And it had a great cast. But that couldn't make up for a script bereft of clever comedy.",Wagons East!
2,JC was part of the 80s  comedy films with far to many to list. In my opinion he is a lost talent and the like of which we will never see again. Originally part of the early SNL team candy was fresh and funny. He along with Eddy Murphy and John B of blues brothers fame was originally going to be in Ghostbusters in 1984 but due to delays and other commitments and the loss of JB this didn't happen. How different it would have been. That said JC style of slapstick comedy was right for the times and had he still be making movies his style would seem somewhat out of date as times chance.,Wagons East!
4,"Ok, so it's goofy & historically inaccurate...  But it's a silly good time.",Wagons East!
1,"So much of this movie felt like they threw together a story at the last minute. The beginning is great. I loved it. Everyone is introduced well. We know their story. But when the group travels east, everything falls apart.

The first ten minutes do a great job of introducing the main characters and showing why they want to leave the west and head back home. But as the group travels, extra people have tagged along. Most notably, a group of guys who have ordered a mail-order bride. The bride runs away with the wagon train, and somehow the guys just appear. We get a brief voice over that comments on this, but it seems more like an afterthought.

1,"Not so great.  Only interesting because it was John Candy's last movie before passing.  A few mild laughs can be found from watching this.  Comparisons to Blazing Saddles are pretty absurd.  Blazing Saddles is an edgy classic comedy that has maintained its humor over a long time.  This movie is a stinker.  I was hoping to enjoy this more.  Lots of familiar faces in this.  Not really even worth the once over, and I don't think I'll be watching it again.",Wagons East!
4,"94 classic i didn't know bout

I just had my first viewing of this movie n i gotta say it was actually good , not saying this was John Candy's best movie but i still enjoyed it n i laughed, i keep seeing people try to compare this to blazing saddles, sayin how it doesn't reach the standard it set for similar movies to follow, but unfortunately as much as i like blazing saddles it's just a lot of kinda racist fueled jokes, i liked the fact wagons east didn't go there know what i mean? i posted a review video on my channel Stoner Watch Productions.... chk it \m/",Wagons East!
5,Incredibly underrated. Forget what these critics say. This movie is an absolute classic.,Wagons East!
2,"I don't know what it is about Western comedies(A Million Ways to Die in the West, Ridiculous 6 to name a couple) but they just seem to not be all that funny, and are real heavy on the dumb. I know this is John Candy's last film and all, and that's partially the reason for the somewhat generous rating, but man.. this was a slog to get through.",Wagons East!
5,"This is a fun and entertaining movie that is worth the watch. 
Mind you that it had to suffer the loss of the lead John Candy during filming, it had an entertaining cast and a different approach to the textbook western. It is not a ""best picture"" movie (however I myself usually think those are all horrible myself) it is entertaining, and that is what a movie is for.",Wagons East!
4,"I actually enjoyed it. It is dumb and funny, but that was the point",Wagons East!
3,"The last movie that the late, great, John Candy filmed in his comedic career. Always worth a viewing when John Candy is on the mix!",Wagons East!
1,I own this movie on DVD. I want to like it so bad!!! I jus can't fool myself into thinking this movie is good in any way. John Candy may he Rest In Peace couldn't even save this complete flop.,Wagons East!
2,Even though this movie stoops low John Candy knows how to save some of it with his goofy persona.,Wagons East!
0,"A horrible satire western where the joke fall flat. Only notable thing about this film is that it is Candy's last, which is a shame for both the audience and Candy.",Wagons East!
5,This was Johns Candys last movie before he died,Wagons East!
1,"Terrible, and Candy's final, film (he died on set in Mexico before filming completed) about a group of pioneers who decide to abandon the western frontier and return east, led by the Donner Party's guide. A few laughs, mostly from the interesting supporting cast, but not enough to be worth wasting an hour and a half.",Wagons East!
1,Yeesh...  It really is as lame as people say.  What a sad movie for Candy to go out on...,Wagons East!
0,"Jesus Christ, I think we finally found out what killed John Candy. What a train wreck of a movie. It was so bad, the store I tried to sell it to didn't want to buy it; I ended up giving the DVD to some random person walking by. I hope they're OK...",Wagons East!
3,An enjoyable and amusing movie! And I thought it had some great characters in it.,Wagons East!
0,Lame comedy about western settlers who decide to move back east.,Wagons East!
0,Funny premise. Not a funny movie.,Wagons East!
5,"Super funny, and this is why Rotten Egg sucks.",Wagons East!
0,holy shit this movie is bad.,Wagons East!
2,John Candy's last film. A dud. But he had an awesome career.,Wagons East!
5,"I've loved this movie from the theatrical release.  It's nothing like Blazing Saddles, nor was it intended to be.",Wagons East!
3,This was a funny movie.,Wagons East!
1,No laughs in the script. Couldn't finish it.,Wagons East!
4,"""they say Phil 's cows.. and hey, I'm Phil!"" hehehe :P I know a lot of people didn't like this movie, but I love it!! don't be so uptight lol",Wagons East!
0,3/30/2014: Not a single laugh throughout. It's too bad that Candy's final movie had to be so bad.,Wagons East!
2,"Could have been better for John's final movie, but, had a few laughs",Wagons East!
2,"By all rights, Wagons East should've been pretty funny, but then for some reason, it just wasn't. Peter Markle does his best Mel Brooks impression as director, but really had no clue how to land a punch line. It was fun to see Robert Picardo and Ethan Phillips in a movie together pre-Star Trek: Voyager, and John C. McGinley was great, but otherwise this movie fell flat everywhere it could. Sad to see John Candy go out on such a sour note.",Wagons East!
0,He who rated such movie with positive feedback should surely be questioning his sanity.,Wagons East!
1,this movie is very bad. think it could of worked but it is just too busy and the concept goes awry which is a shame b/c it was john candy's last movie so really wanted it to work for his benefit. :(   definitely pass on this one,Wagons East!
2,"Candy's last cinematic offering lacks in many areas, with a ploddingly slow first act, tasteless gags that run the gambit from toilet to rape, and a stock of stock cast of characters, complete with redneck brothers, saucy young bride and even the token 90s gay guy. However, at least director Peter Markle concedes with Wagons' short run time, competent cinematography with some nice desert vistas, and even the odd chuckle with some Looney Tunes-esque sight gags in the second and third acts and of course, Candy's trademark burly charm that reminds us that, even in the end, he was a true trooper.",Wagons East!
2,"I was so sad for Candy that this was his final film. I woner if the movie were changed cause of his death, cause he doesn't seem to get a lot to do in the film. Was cool seeing Greene in something other than Little Shop Of Horrors, and early roles by Munro and McGinley...but the later plays an over the top gay Cowboy that should offend many!

Lauter plays this superhuman bad guy trying to stop these people from moving back east and that sideplot is just a mess. He keeps surviving things that would kill a hundred normal humans.

In the end, the film just never does anything special and is very boring. Not a good swan song for Candy sadly.",Wagons East!
0,Horrible. Didn't finish it,Wagons East!
3,This was funny!  John Candy had a great last movie!  They need to have more critics review these. Its way better than a 0.,Wagons East!
3,"Wagons East is an entertaining and underrated film that was the last feature starring John Candy, who died on the set of the film. The film does boast some flaws, but is nonetheless fun, humorous and well acted. Although not as great as other Western comedies, this is a film that still manages to overcome its flaws due to Candy's usually memorable screen presence. Wagons East is not as great as Blazing Saddles, but it manages to be a whimsical comedy that doesn't deserve the flack it has received. Although not the best John Candy film, this is not a bad movie either. In terms of a comedy, this is a humorous picture that definitely should be seen.  The cast here are good and aside from John Candy, John C. McGinley is one of the standout aspects of the film as homosexual bookseller Julian. I thought he was very funny in his performance, and I always enjoy McGinley's work no matter what he does. Watching Wagons East, I don't understand all the hatred that the film has garnered upon its release and it definitely is an underrated movie that brings on a few good laughs, an interesting story and a few standout performances.  Although it had its fair share of flaws, I quite enjoyed this comedy yarn and it doesn't deserve all the negative reviews it has received. Wagons East is no Blazing Saddles, but it makes a pretty mindless hour and a half of comedic fun that isn't that bad. This is one of those films that are underrated for what it is, and though it is far from the best Western comedy, it's not the worst. If you enjoy John Candy, give this one a shot. Unfortunately this was his final film, but at least he managed to make me laugh one last time with this one.",Wagons East!
1,"John Candy's final film, and sadly, it's not very funny. Or good.",Wagons East!
0,"A film as desolate and and empty as loss of John Candy.   Considering his presence in the film, it ironically lacks soul. A sad way for John to end his life. Working on this.  Roger Ebert said his legacy would survive this, and thank god it did.",Wagons East!
5,A  group  of  people  get  sick  of  living  in  the  west  so  they  hire  a  alchoholic  wagon  Master  to  head  them  out  east.  And  they  find  out  that  he  was  a  member  of  the  Donner part  who  resorted  to  cannibalism. It  ius  so  funny.  Also  tycoons  hire  a  hitman  to  stop  the  journey  who  ends  up  being  like  Wild  E  Coyote  who   evry  trap  he  sets  for  the  Roadrunner  ends  up   blwing  up  in  his  face. And  they  also  run  into  indians  who  end  up  helping  them  because  they  figure  with  all  the  whites  heading  east  they  will  get  their  land  back. Sadly  this  was  John  Candy's  last  movie  before  he  died. It's  not  his  best  movie  but  I  thought  it  was  pretty  funny  and  a  good  decent  comedy. It  got  alot  of  bad  reviews  but  I  thought  it  was  a  good  comedy  western  and  a  good  last  performance  from  the  legendary  John  Candy. R.I.P   John  you  are  missed.,Wagons East!
2,Excruciatingly dull.,Wagons East!
1,"Sloppy, boring, unfunny and stupid 'Wagons East' went way off-horizon.",Wagons East!
1,A sad way for a wonderful comic talent to go out on.,Wagons East!
2,"While this was Candy's last movie (he died while filming it), it was not his worst. That would be It Seemed like a Good Idea at the Time. 
This isn't a zero-worthy film, but no Spaceballs.",Wagons East!
2,"Completely silly but at times quite heartwarming light comedy western about a colorful group of people migrating towards East in the 1860√¢(TM)s. The tone is low-brow, but the cast make everything lively and dynamic. Very good entertainment for the whole family, if not a particularly commendable cinematic achievement.",Wagons East!
2,Too bad Candy's last film had to be this one.,Wagons East!
3,Not John Candy's best work but has a nostalga factor to it because of his untimely death during the filming!,Wagons East!
2,"Cute western parody and John Candy's last film. Mostly predictable, but there are some inspired parts and a few genuine laughs in there. A worthwhile film that any lover of the western genre - such as myself - is sure to enjoy.",Wagons East!
3,"Underrated comedy. Not comic gold, but perhaps copper, which is still worth something.",Wagons East!
3,i actualy thought this was funny john candy makes it funny hes a funny guy richard lewis is funny too so i think its funny,Wagons East!
1,Predictable. The creative burners were turned low for this one. An unfortunately disappointing last for John Candy.,Wagons East!
2,It's a shame that John Candy's last role was so forgettable.,Wagons East!
3,"They weren't no Lewis and Clark, but it was still funny""",Wagons East!
2,One of John Candy's worst movies. It isn't very funny and is not something I want to see again. (First and only viewing - 2/14/2011),Wagons East!
3,Reminiscent of Mel Brooks' so-so 90s movies. Not quite Blazing Saddles.,Wagons East!
0,"Don't be fooled, just because you see John Candy's name on the poster doesn't make this a good film. This is just a boring movie with a boring plot and boring characters.",Wagons East!
3,"Wagons East! isn't really so much a bad film as it is a film designed for a niche. The jokes take a certain brand of humor to appreciate, a type of humor that is somewhat rare.

The film itself is similar to Blazing Saddles, in fact it could be classified as the Poor Man's BS, in a sense. If you liked Blazing Saddles, you just may enjoy Wagons East! as well.",Wagons East!
4,John Candy's last film. Very funny.,Wagons East!
4,"Good movie, very funny!",Wagons East!
3,"What a sad way to end John Candy's career with his death in March 1994 it seemed like the audience back then was too sad to enjoy it and that would explain for it's disasterous box office failure. It took me a couple of viewings and I finally saw it, Recently I tried to watch it again but I didn't have it in me. You could tell in some scenes he looked miserable and he did look sick and for the producers who claim that Candy finished the film! THINK AGAIN! I noticed a couple of scenes where there was indeed a Double and not really John, here are some examples: 1. The scene where it's snowing Richard Lewis and Robert Picardo see Candy leaving it is not him it's his stand-in who appears to be thin. 2. there was a scene in the bar near the end of the film when the bartender and a customer are talking about the U.S. Army going after the wagon train, you can see Candy pouring his whiskey on a table that was a re-used clip (but when the whiskey bottle hit the table it was not Candy doing that) from the scene in the beginning where Candy explains that he wants the job as wagonmaster. In my opinion they should have just abandoned the film, did the film crew think we were stupid that we weren't going to notice these changes? There were a few funny scenes but it didn't help  but to look away in misery.",Wagons East!
4,i love westerns and it was funny,Wagons East!
3,"a lesser-known classic, must see for John Candy fans that might have missed it",Wagons East!
3,"humorous western parody. Laugh out loud John Candy performance is little weak in comedy, but plausible.",Wagons East!
3,I think this was one of John Candy's last films.,Wagons East!
5,Funny... I love John Candy :),Wagons East!
3,"One of those movies where I saw the box and groaned when my husband wanted to watch it, but that I ended up enjoying the movie overall in the end.  It was pretty funny and the cast was very good.",Wagons East!
2,"Veyry difficult viewing here.  It's just not very good and not even Candy can save this one, he looks decidedly unwell throughout.  There's nothing else to say.",Wagons East!
2,"Although genuinely funny at times, there is only one way to acurately describe Wagon's East -- predictable. 
While watching for the first time, we found ourselves consistently predicting this movie's punchllines and were correct far more times than not. That said, the timing still brought out a few good laughs.",Wagons East!

2,Too bad Candy's last film had to be this one.,Wagons East!
3,John C. McGinly (Dr. Cox) was the best part of this movie,Wagons East!
4,this is a really good movie!,Wagons East!
3,"I don't usually like this type of movie, but it managed to be funny without being really crude or just plain stupid.
   John C. McGinley's character was the reason I watched this movie in the first place. I love him in Scrubs, and he is just as hilarious here!",Wagons East!
4,"The film's biggest assets are the quirky characters and the well defined story lines and sub-plots. For a film of this genre, the directors and actors did a good job of keeping the film from going stale. The pacing and the balance of slapstick with subtle one-liners adds to the appeal. For a comedy to have Native American characters actually speaking in Lakota is worthy of special mention. 

My favorite character in the film is Julian. He epitomizes the film's emphasis on satirizing the rich and powerful and exposing the absurdity of many of the most common and destructive stereotypes still present in Motion Pictures.",Wagons East!
1,"Not the best way to go out, too bad John.",Wagons East!
1,JC's last movie.  What a piece of crap.,Wagons East!

4,A decent movie. Worth watching at least once in your life. A nice tribute to John Candy who died during the filming of this movie.,Wagons East!
0,"Candy plays a wagonmaster of questionable skills who is hired to escort a group of pioneers that are disheartened with the wild West. Richard Lewis is terrible in this and John Candy...well he died near the end of this production, so sad that this would be his last film 'cause it's a terrible movie.",Wagons East!
3,"Though this was the last film that John Candy was in, it was filmed after Canadian Bacon, but was released in 1994.  Mr John Candy died during the making of Wagons East while filming in Mexico.  The film is okay.  Sort of funny, but isn't like anyother Candy films.  Watch it to watch.",Wagons East!
2,"John Candy, rest in peace. Not a very good movie though.",Wagons East!

3,One of John Candy's better movies.,Wagons East!
3,"This is a dark comedy that my whole family enjoyed when I was a kid and it first came out. It wouldn't sit well currently as the PC culture is pretty strong. 

Tom Selleck's company is involved in illegal activities, he isn't involved, but no one believes him and the luck just goes down from there. Dark part comes when they decide to claim life insurance money from his father but he's still alive, and mostly senile. Selleck seems to be cursed for going along with such a terrible idea by getting beat/damaged/injured physically, but it never works and no one dies. The movie is both terrible and endearing and it has a happy ending with a nice twist on a misunderstanding of the grandfather's dementia.",Folks!
4,"I loved this movie, I needed to laugh and this was perfect, I watched it 5 times. It's so funny, poor Tom...lol...its an older movie, but keep that in mind and you will enjoy yourself.

2,"This was billed as a knee-slappingly funny comedy, but it devolved into a sad, schmaltzy snooze-fest. The late Don Ameche had limitless acting abilities and it's his role that keeps the film going. Blame Tom Selleck's character. He simply phoned that role in. Avery flat movie with too few light-hearted moments and too many exchanges of pithy banter.",Folks!

3,"Un film plein de rebondissement efficace pour un public tres avertis. Donc je dois dire que c'est un film pour tous et ce ... pour longtemps encore. tom Selleck (sans moustache) est impeccable, c'est un role qu'il est nee pour(l'humour), mais le weatern est plus payant. Bref. Ce film est un ensemble qui forme un tout.
